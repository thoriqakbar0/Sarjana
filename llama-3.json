They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1)a pre-training stage in which\\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\\nand(2)a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\\nand improve speci\ufb01c capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the results presented in this paper are for the Llama 3.1 models,\\nwhich we will refer to as Llama 3 throughout for brevity.\\nWe believe there are three key levers in the development of high-quality foundation models: data, scale, and\\nmanaging complexity. We seek to optimize for these three levers in our development process:\\n\u2022Data.Compared to prior versions of Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), we improved both the quantity and\\nqualityofthedataweuseforpre-trainingandpost-training. Theseimprovementsincludethedevelopment\\nof more careful pre-processing and curation pipelines for pre-training data and the development of more\\nrigorous quality assurance and \ufb01ltering approaches for post-training data. We pre-train Llama 3 on a\\ncorpus of about 15T multilingual tokens, compared to 1.8T tokens for Llama 2.\\n\u2022Scale.We train a model at far larger scale than previous Llama models: our \ufb02agship language model was\\npre-trained using 3.8\u00d71025FLOPs, almost 50\u00d7more than the largest version of Llama 2.

While our scaling laws suggest our \ufb02agship model is an approximately compute-optimal\\nsize for our training budget, we also train our smaller models for much longer than is compute-optimal.\\nThe resulting models perform better than compute-optimal models at the same inference budget. We\\nuse the \ufb02agship model to further improve the quality of those smaller models during post-training.\\n\u2022Managing complexity. We make design choices that seek to maximize our ability to scale the model\\ndevelopment process. For example, we opt for a standard dense Transformer model architecture (Vaswani\\net al., 2017) with minor adaptations, rather than for a mixture-of-experts model (Shazeer et al., 2017)\\nto maximize training stability. Similarly, we adopt a relatively simple post-training procedure based\\non supervised \ufb01netuning (SFT), rejection sampling (RS), and direct preference optimization (DPO;\\nRafailov et al. (2023)) as opposed to more complex reinforcement learning algorithms (Ouyang et al.,\\n2022; Schulman et al., 2017) that tend to be less stable and harder to scale.\\nThe result of our work is Llama 3: a herd of three multilingual1language models with 8B, 70B, and 405B\\nparameters. We evaluate the performance of Llama 3 on a plethora of benchmark datasets that span a wide\\nrange of language understanding tasks. In addition, we perform extensive human evaluations that compare\\nLlama 3 with competing models. An overview of the performance of the \ufb02agship Llama 3 model on key\\nbenchmarks is presented in Table 2. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our \ufb02agship model performs\\non par with leading language models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a) across a variety of tasks, and is close to\\nmatching the state-of-the-art. Our smaller models are best-in-class, outperforming alternative models with\\nsimilar numbers of parameters (Bai et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Llama 3 also delivers a much better\\nbalance between helpfulness and harmlessness than its predecessor (Touvron et al., 2023b). We present a\\ndetailed analysis of the safety of Llama 3 in Section 5.4.\\nWe are publicly releasing all three Llama 3 models under an updated version of the Llama 3 Community License;\\nseehttps://llama.meta.com . This includes pre-trained and post-trained versions of our 405B parameter\\nlanguage model and a new version of our Llama Guard model (Inan et al., 2023) for input and output safety.\\nWe hope that the open release of a \ufb02agship model will spur a wave of innovation in the research community,\\nand accelerate a responsible path towards the development of arti\ufb01cial general intelligence (AGI).\\nAs part of the Llama 3 development process we also develop multimodal extensions to the models, enabling\\nimage recognition, video recognition, and speech understanding capabilities. These models are still under\\nactive development and not yet ready for release. In addition to our language modeling results, the paper\\npresents results of our initial experiments with those multimodal models.\\n1The Llama 3 8B and 70B were pre-trained on multilingual data but were intended for use in English at the time.\\n2' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 1}", "page_content='Category Benchmark\\nLlama 3 8B\\nGemma 2 9B\\nMistral 7B\\nLlama 3 70B\\nMixtral 8x22B\\nGPT 3.5 Turbo\\nLlama 3 405B\\nNemotron 4 340B\\nGPT-4 (0125)\\nGPT-4o\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\\nGeneralMMLU (5-shot) 69.4 72.361.1 83.676.970.787.382.6 85.189.1 89.9\\nMMLU (0-shot, CoT) 73.0 72.3\u25b360.5 86.079.969.888.6 78.7\u25c185.4 88.7 88.3\\nMMLU-Pro (5-shot, CoT) 48.3 \u201336.9 66.456.349.273.362.7 64.874.0 77.0\\nIFEval 80.4 73.657.6 87.572.769.9 88.6 85.1 84.385.6 88.0\\nCodeHumanEval (0-shot) 72.6 54.340.2 80.575.668.089.073.2 86.690.2 92.0\\nMBPP EvalPlus (0-shot) 72.8 71.749.5 86.078.682.088.672.8 83.687.8 90.5\\nMathGSM8K (8-shot, CoT) 84.5 76.753.2 95.188.281.6 96.8 92.3\u266694.296.1 96.4\u2666\\nMATH (0-shot, CoT) 51.9 44.313.0 68.054.143.173.841.1 64.5 76.6 71.1\\nReasoningARC Challenge (0-shot) 83.4 87.674.2 94.888.783.7 96.9 94.6 96.496.7 96.7\\nGPQA (0-shot, CoT) 32.8 \u201328.8 46.733.330.851.1 \u201341.453.6 59.4\\nTool useBFCL 76.1 \u201360.484.8\u2013 85.988.586.5 88.380.5 90.2\\nNexus 38.5 30.024.7 56.748.537.2 58.7 \u201350.356.1 45.7\\nLong contextZeroSCROLLS/QuALITY 81.0 \u2013\u201390.5\u2013\u2013 95.2 \u2013 95.2 90.5 90.5\\nIn\ufb01niteBench/En.MC 65.1 \u2013\u201378.2\u2013\u2013 83.4 \u201372.182.5 \u2013\\nNIH/Multi-needle 98.8 \u2013\u201397.5\u2013\u201398.1 \u2013 100.0 100.0 90.8\\nMultilingual MGSM (0-shot, CoT) 68.9 53.229.9 86.971.151.4 91.6 \u201385.990.5 91.6\\nTable 2 Performance of finetuned Llama 3 models on key benchmark evaluations.

The development of our Llama 3 language\\nmodels comprises two main stages:\\n\u2022Language model pre-training. We start by converting a large, multilingual text corpus to discrete tokens\\nand pre-training a large language model (LLM) on the resulting data to perform next-token prediction.\\nIn the language model pre-training stage, the model learns the structure of language and obtains large\\namounts of knowledge about the world from the text it is \u201creading\u201d. To do this e\ufb00ectively, pre-training\\nis performed at massive scale: we pre-train a model with 405B parameters on 15.6T tokens using a\\ncontext window of 8K tokens. This standard pre-training stage is followed by a continued pre-training\\nstage that increases the supported context window to 128K tokens. See Section 3 for details.\\n\u2022Language model post-training. The pre-trained language model has a rich understanding of language\\nbut it does not yet follow instructions or behave in the way we would expect an assistant to. We\\nalign the model with human feedback in several rounds, each of which involves supervised \ufb01netuning\\n(SFT) on instruction tuning data and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024).\\nAt this post-training2stage, we also integrate new capabilities, such as tool-use, and observe strong\\nimprovements in other areas, such as coding and reasoning. See Section 4 for details. Finally, safety\\nmitigations are also incorporated into the model at the post-training stage, the details of which are\\ndescribed in Section 5.4.\\nThe resulting models have a rich set of capabilities. They can answer questions in at least eight languages,\\nwrite high-quality code, solve complex reasoning problems, and use tools out-of-the-box or in a zero-shot way.\\nWe also perform experiments in which we add image, video, and speech capabilities to Llama 3 using a\\ncompositional approach. The approach we study comprises the three additional stages illustrated in Figure 28:\\n\u2022Multi-modal encoder pre-training. We train separate encoders for images and speech. We train our\\nimage encoder on large amounts of image-text pairs. This teaches the model the relation between visual\\ncontent and the description of that content in natural language. Our speech encoder is trained using a' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 2}", "page_content='content and the description of that content in natural language.

As a result, the model learns the structure of speech\\nsignals. See Section 7 for details on the image encoder and Section 8 for details on the speech encoder.\\n\u2022Vision adapter training. We train an adapter that integrates the pre-trained image encoder into the\\npre-trained language model. The adapter consists of a series of cross-attention layers that feed image-\\nencoder representations into the language model. The adapter is trained on text-image pairs. This\\naligns the image representations with the language representations. During adapter training, we also\\nupdate the parameters of the image encoder but we intentionally do not update the language-model\\nparameters. We also train a video adapter on top of the image adapter on paired video-text data. This\\nenables the model to aggregate information across frames. See Section 7 for details.\\n\u2022Speech adapter training. Finally, we integrate the speech encoder into the model via an adapter that\\nconverts speech encodings into token representations that can be fed directly into the \ufb01netuned language\\nmodel. The parameters of the adapter and encoder are jointly updated in a supervised \ufb01netuning stage\\nto enable high-quality speech understanding. We do not change the language model during speech\\nadapter training. We also integrate a text-to-speech system. See Section 8 for details.\\nOur multimodal experiments lead to models that can recognize the content of images and videos, and support\\ninteraction via a speech interface. These models are still under development and not yet ready for release.\\n3 Pre-Training\\nLanguage model pre-training involves: (1)the curation and \ufb01ltering of a large-scale training corpus, (2)the\\ndevelopment of a model architecture and corresponding scaling laws for determining model size, (3)the\\ndevelopment of techniques for e\ufb03cient pre-training at large scale, and (4)the development of a pre-training\\nrecipe. We present each of these components separately below.\\n3.1 Pre-Training Data\\nWe create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge\\nuntil the end of 2023. We apply several de-duplication methods and data cleaning mechanisms on each data\\nsource to obtain high-quality tokens. We remove domains that contain large amounts of personally identi\ufb01able\\ninformation (PII), and domains with known adult content.\\n3.1.1 Web Data Curation\\nMuch of the data we utilize is obtained from the web and we describe our cleaning process below.\\nPII and safety filtering. Among other mitigations, we implement \ufb01lters designed to remove data from websites\\nare likely to contain unsafe content or high volumes of PII, domains that have been ranked as harmful\\naccording to a variety of Meta safety standards, and domains that are known to contain adult content.\\n4' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 3}", "page_content='Text extraction and cleaning. We process the raw HTML content for non-truncated web documents to extract\\nhigh-quality diverse text. To do so, we build a custom parser that extracts the HTML content and optimizes\\nfor precision in boilerplate removal and content recall. We evaluate our parser\u2019s quality in human evaluations,\\ncomparing it with popular third-party HTML parsers that optimize for article-like content, and found it\\nto perform favorably. We carefully process HTML pages with mathematics and code content to preserve\\nthe structure of that content. We maintain the image altattribute text since mathematical content is often\\nrepresented as pre-rendered images where the math is also provided in the altattribute. We experimentally\\nevaluate di\ufb00erent cleaning con\ufb01gurations. We \ufb01nd markdown is harmful to the performance of a model that\\nis primarily trained on web data compared to plain text, so we remove all markdown markers.\\nDe-duplication. We apply several rounds of de-duplication at the URL, document, and line level:\\n\u2022URL-level de-duplication. We perform URL-level de-duplication across the entire dataset. We keep the\\nmost recent version for pages corresponding to each URL.\\n\u2022Document-level de-duplication. We perform global MinHash (Broder, 1997) de-duplication across the\\nentire dataset to remove near duplicate documents.\\n\u2022Line-level de-duplication. We perform aggressive line-level de-duplication similar to ccNet(Wenzek\\net al., 2019). We remove lines that appeared more than 6 times in each bucket of 30M documents.\\nAlthough our manual qualitative analysis showed that the line-level de-duplication removes not only\\nleftover boilerplate from various websites such as navigation menus, cookie warnings, but also frequent\\nhigh-quality text, our empirical evaluations showed strong improvements.\\nHeuristic filtering. We develop heuristics to remove additional low-quality documents, outliers, and documents\\nwith excessive repetitions. Some examples of heuristics include:\\n\u2022We use duplicated n-gram coverage ratio (Rae et al., 2021) to remove lines that consist of repeated\\ncontent such as logging or error messages. Those lines could be very long and unique, hence cannot be\\n\ufb01ltered by line-dedup.\\n\u2022We use \u201cdirty word\u201d counting (Ra\ufb00el et al., 2020) to \ufb01lter out adult websites that are not covered by\\ndomain block lists.\\n\u2022We use a token-distribution Kullback-Leibler divergence to \ufb01lter out documents containing excessive\\nnumbers of outlier tokens compared to the training corpus distribution.\\nModel-based quality filtering. Further, we experiment with applying various model-based quality classi\ufb01ers\\nto sub-select high-quality tokens. These include using fast classi\ufb01ers such as fasttext (Joulin et al., 2017)\\ntrained to recognize if a given text would be referenced by Wikipedia (Touvron et al., 2023a), as well as more\\ncompute-intensive Roberta-based classi\ufb01ers (Liu et al., 2019a) trained on Llama 2 predictions. To train a\\nquality classi\ufb01er based on Llama 2, we create a training set of cleaned web documents, describe the quality\\nrequirements, and instruct Llama 2\u2019s chat model to determine if the documents meets these requirements. We\\nuse DistilRoberta (Sanh et al., 2019) to generate quality scores for each document for e\ufb03ciency reasons. We\\nexperimentally evaluate the e\ufb03cacy of various quality \ufb01ltering con\ufb01gurations.\\nCode and reasoning data. Similar to DeepSeek-AI et al. (2024), we build domain-speci\ufb01c pipelines that extract\\ncode and math-relevant web pages. Speci\ufb01cally, both the code and reasoning classi\ufb01ers are DistilledRoberta\\nmodels trained on web data annotated by Llama 2. Unlike the general quality classi\ufb01er mentioned above, we\\nconduct prompt tuning to target web pages containing math deduction, reasoning in STEM areas and code\\ninterleaved with natural language. Since the token distribution of code and math is substantially di\ufb00erent\\nthan that of natural language, these pipelines implement domain-speci\ufb01c HTML extraction, customized text' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 4}", "page_content='than that of natural language, these pipelines implement domain-speci\ufb01c HTML extraction, customized text\\nfeatures and heuristics for \ufb01ltering.\\nMultilingual data.

Our multilingual text processing\\npipeline has several unique features:\\n\u2022We use a fasttext-based language identi\ufb01cation model to categorize documents into 176 languages.\\n\u2022We perform document-level and line-level de-duplication within data for each language.\\n5' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 4}", "page_content='\u2022We apply language-speci\ufb01c heuristics and model-based \ufb01lters to remove low-quality documents.\\nIn addition, we perform quality ranking of multilingual documents using a multilingual Llama 2-based classi\ufb01er\\nto ensure that high-quality content is prioritized. We determine the amount of multilingual tokens used in\\npre-training experimentally, balancing model performance on English and multilingual benchmarks.\\n3.1.2 Determining the Data Mix\\nTo obtain a high-quality language model, it is essential to carefully determine the proportion of di\ufb00erent data\\nsources in the pre-training data mix. Our main tools in determining this data mix are knowledge classi\ufb01cation\\nand scaling law experiments.\\nKnowledge classification. We develop a classi\ufb01er to categorize the types of information contained in our web\\ndata to more e\ufb00ectively determine a data mix. We use this classi\ufb01er to downsample data categories that are\\nover-represented on the web, for example, arts and entertainment.\\nScaling laws for data mix. To determine the best data mix, we perform scaling law experiments in which we\\ntrain several small models on a data mix and use that to predict the performance of a large model on that mix\\n(see Section 3.2.1). We repeat this process multiple times for di\ufb00erent data mixes to select a new data mix\\ncandidate. Subsequently, we train a larger model on this candidate data mix and evaluate the performance of\\nthat model on several key benchmarks.\\nData mix summary. Our \ufb01nal data mix contains roughly 50% of tokens corresponding to general knowledge,\\n25% of mathematical and reasoning tokens, 17% code tokens, and 8% multilingual tokens.\\n3.1.3 Annealing Data\\nEmpirically, we \ufb01nd that annealing (see Section 3.4.3) on small amounts of high-quality code and mathematical\\ndata can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks. Akin to Li et al. (2024b), we\\nperform annealing with a data mix that upsamples high-quality data in select domains. We do not include\\nany training sets from commonly used benchmarks in our annealing data. This enables us to assess the true\\nfew-shot learning capabilities and out-of-domain generalization of Llama 3.\\nFollowing OpenAI (2023a), we evaluate the e\ufb03cacy of annealing on the GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) and\\nMATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) training sets in annealing. We \ufb01nd that annealing improved the performance\\nof a pre-trained Llama 3 8B model on the GSM8k and MATH validation sets by 24.0% and 6.4%, respectively.\\nHowever, the improvements on the 405B model are negligible, suggesting that our \ufb02agship model has strong\\nin-context learning and reasoning capabilities and does not require speci\ufb01c in-domain training samples to\\nobtain strong performance.\\nUsing annealing to assess data quality. Similar to Blakeney et al. (2024), we \ufb01nd that annealing enables us to\\njudge the value of small domain-speci\ufb01c datasets. We measure the value of such datasets by annealing the\\nlearning rate of a 50% trained Llama 3 8B model linearly to 0 on 40B tokens. In those experiments, we assign\\n30% weight to the new dataset and the remaining 70% weight to the default data mix. Using annealing to\\nevaluate new data sources is more e\ufb03cient than performing scaling law experiments for every small dataset.\\n3.2 Model Architecture\\nLlama 3 uses a standard, dense Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017).

In addition to determining the optimal model size,\\na major challenge is to forecast the \ufb02agship model\u2019s performance on downstream benchmark tasks, due to a\\ncouple of issues: (1) Existing scaling laws typically predict only next-token prediction loss rather than speci\ufb01c\\nbenchmark performance. (2) Scaling laws can be noisy and unreliable because they are developed based on\\npre-training runs conducted with small compute budgets (Wei et al., 2022b).\\nTo address these challenges, we implement a two-stage methodology to develop scaling laws that accurately\\npredict downstream benchmark performance:\\n1.We \ufb01rst establish a correlation between the compute-optimal model\u2019s negative log-likelihood on down-\\nstream tasks and the training FLOPs.\\n2.Next, we correlate the negative log-likelihood on downstream tasks with task accuracy, utilizing both the\\nscaling law models and older models trained with higher compute FLOPs. In this step, we speci\ufb01cally\\nleverage the Llama 2 family of models.\\nThis approach enables us to predict downstream task performance given a speci\ufb01c number of training FLOPs\\nfor compute-optimal models. We use a similar method to select our pre-training data mix (see Section 3.4).\\nScaling law experiments. Concretely, we construct our scaling laws by pre-training models using compute\\nbudgets between 6\u00d71018FLOPs and 1022FLOPs. At each compute budget, we pre-train models ranging\\nin size between 40M and 16B parameters, using a subset of model sizes at each compute budget. In these\\ntraining runs, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with a linear warmup for 2,000 training steps. The peak\\nlearning rate is set between 2\u00d710\u22124and4\u00d710\u22124depending on the size of the model. We set the cosine\\ndecay to 0.1 of the peak value. The weight decay at each step is set to 0.1 times the learning rate at that step.\\nWe use a \ufb01xed batch size for each compute scale, ranging between 250K and 4M.\\n3https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/tree/main\\n7' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 6}", "page_content='101010111012\\nTraining Tokens0.700.750.800.850.900.95Validation Loss\\nCompute\\n6e18\\n1e19\\n3e19\\n6e19\\n1e20\\n3e20\\n6e20\\n1e21\\n3e21\\n1e22Figure 2 Scaling law IsoFLOPs curves between 6\u00d71018\\nand 1022FLOPs.

In this\\nanalysis, we use only the scaling law models trained up to 1022FLOPs on the data mix described above. Next,\\nwe establish a sigmoidal relation between the log-likelihood and accuracy using both the scaling law models\\nand Llama 2 models, which were trained using the Llama 2 data mix and tokenizer.

Llama 3 405B is trained on up to 16K H100 GPUs, each running at 700W TDP with 80GB HBM3,\\nusing Meta\u2019s Grand Teton AI server platform (Matt Bowman, 2022). Each server is equipped with eight GPUs\\nand two CPUs. Within a server, the eight GPUs are connected via NVLink. Training jobs are scheduled\\nusing MAST (Choudhury et al., 2024), Meta\u2019s global-scale training scheduler.\\nStorage. Tectonic (Pan et al., 2021), Meta\u2019s general-purpose distributed \ufb01le system, is used to build a storage\\nfabric (Battey and Gupta, 2024) for Llama 3 pre-training. It o\ufb00ers 240 PB of storage out of 7,500 servers\\nequipped with SSDs, and supports a sustainable throughput of 2 TB/s and a peak throughput of 7 TB/s. A\\nmajor challenge is supporting the highly bursty checkpoint writes that saturate the storage fabric for short\\ndurations. Checkpointing saves each GPU\u2019s model state, ranging from 1 MB to 4 GB per GPU, for recovery\\nand debugging. We aim to minimize GPU pause time during checkpointing and increase checkpoint frequency\\nto reduce the amount of lost work after a recovery.\\nNetwork. Llama 3 405B used RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) fabric based on the Arista 7800\\nand Minipack2 Open Compute Project4OCP rack switches. Smaller models in the Llama 3 family were\\ntrained using Nvidia Quantum2 In\ufb01niband fabric. Both RoCE and In\ufb01niband clusters leverage 400 Gbps\\ninterconnects between GPUs. Despite the underlying network technology di\ufb00erences between these clusters,\\nwe tune both of them to provide equivalent performance for these large training workloads. We elaborate\\nfurther on our RoCE network since we fully own its design.\\n\u2022Network topology. Our RoCE-based AI cluster comprises 24K GPUs5connected by a three-layer Clos\\nnetwork (Lee et al., 2024). At the bottom layer, each rack hosts 16 GPUs split between two servers and\\nconnected by a single Minipack2 top-of-the-rack (ToR) switch. In the middle layer, 192 such racks are\\nconnected by Cluster Switches to form a pod of 3,072 GPUs with full bisection bandwidth, ensuring no\\noversubscription. At the top layer, eight such pods within the same datacenter building are connected via\\nAggregation Switches to form a cluster of 24K GPUs. However, network connectivity at the aggregation\\nlayer does not maintain full bisection bandwidth and instead has an oversubscription ratio of 1:7. Our\\nmodel parallelism methods (see Section 3.3.2) and training job scheduler (Choudhury et al., 2024) are\\nall optimized to be aware of network topology, aiming to minimize network communication across pods.\\n\u2022Load balancing. LLM training produces fat network \ufb02ows that are hard to load balance across all\\navailable network paths using traditional methods such as Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. To\\naddress this challenge, we employ two techniques. First, our collective library creates 16 network \ufb02ows\\nbetween two GPUs, instead of just one, thereby reducing the tra\ufb03c per \ufb02ow and providing more \ufb02ows\\n4Open Compute Project: https://www.opencompute.org/\\n5Note that we use only up to 16K of these 24K GPUs for Llama 3 pre-training.\\n9' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 8}", "page_content='GPUs TP CP PP DP Seq.

Second, our Enhanced-ECMP (E-ECMP) protocol e\ufb00ectively balances these 16 \ufb02ows\\nacross di\ufb00erent network paths by hashing on additional \ufb01elds in the RoCE header of packets.\\n\u2022Congestion control. We use deep-bu\ufb00er switches in the spine (Gangidi et al., 2024) to accommodate\\ntransient congestion and bu\ufb00ering caused by collective communication patterns. This setup helps\\nlimit the impact of persistent congestion and network back pressure caused by slow servers, which is\\ncommon in training. Finally, better load balancing through E-ECMP signi\ufb01cantly reduces the chance\\nof congestion. With these optimizations, we successfully run a 24K GPU cluster without traditional\\ncongestion control methods such as Data Center Quantized Congestion Noti\ufb01cation (DCQCN).\\n3.3.2 Parallelism for Model Scaling\\nTo scale training for our largest models, we use 4D parallelism\u2014a combination of four di\ufb00erent types of\\nparallelism methods\u2014to shard the model. This approach e\ufb03ciently distributes computation across many\\nGPUs and ensures each GPU\u2019s model parameters, optimizer states, gradients, and activations \ufb01t in its\\nHBM. Our implementation of 4D parallelism is illustrated in Figure 5. It combines tensor parallelism (TP;\\nKrizhevsky et al. (2012); Shoeybi et al. (2019); Korthikanti et al. (2023)), pipeline parallelism (PP; Huang\\net al. (2019); Narayanan et al. (2021); Lamy-Poirier (2023)), context parallelism (CP; Liu et al. (2023a)), and\\ndata parallelism (DP; Rajbhandari et al. (2020); Ren et al. (2021); Zhao et al. (2023b)).\\nTensor parallelism splits individual weight tensors into multiple chunks on di\ufb00erent devices. Pipeline parallelism\\npartitions the model vertically into stages by layers, so that di\ufb00erent devices can process in parallel di\ufb00erent\\nstages of the full model pipeline. Context parallelism divides the input context into segments, reducing memory\\nbottleneck for very long sequence length inputs. We use fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP; Rajbhandari\\net al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023b), which shards the model, optimizer, and gradients while\\nimplementing data parallelism which processes data in parallel on multiple GPUs and synchronizes after each\\ntraining step. Our use of FSDP for Llama 3 shards optimizer states and gradients, but for model shards we do\\nnot reshard after forward computation to avoid an extra all-gather communication during backward passes.\\nGPU utilization. Through careful tuning of the parallelism con\ufb01guration, hardware, and software, we achieve\\nan overall BF16 Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU; Chowdhery et al. (2023)) of 38-43% for the con\ufb01gurations\\nshown in Table 4. The slight drop in MFU to 41% on 16K GPUs with DP=128 compared to 43% on 8K\\nGPUs with DP=64 is due to the lower batch size per DP group needed to keep the global tokens per batch\\nconstant during training.\\nPipeline parallelism improvements. We encountered several challenges with existing implementations:\\n\u2022Batch size constraint. Current implementations have constraints on supported batch size per GPU,\\nrequiring it to be divisible by the number of pipeline stages. For the example in Figure 6, the depth-\ufb01rst\\nschedule (DFS) of pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2021) requires N=PP= 4, while the\\nbreadth-\ufb01rst schedule (BFS; Lamy-Poirier (2023)) requires N=M, whereMis the total number\\nof micro-batches and Nis the number of contiguous micro-batches for the same stage\u2019s forward or\\nbackward.

Finally, to reduce memory cost, based on detailed memory allocation pro\ufb01ling, we proactively\\ndeallocate tensors that will not be used for future computation, including the input and output tensors of each\\npipeline stage, that will not be used for future computation.

The order of parallelism dimensions, [TP, CP, PP, DP], is optimized\\nfor network communication. The innermost parallelism requires the highest network bandwidth and lowest\\nlatency, and hence is usually constrained to within the same server. The outermost parallelism may spread\\nacross a multi-hop network and should tolerate higher network latency. Therefore, based on the requirements\\nfor network bandwidth and latency, we place parallelism dimensions in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP]. DP\\n(i.e., FSDP) is the outermost parallelism because it can tolerate longer network latency by asynchronously\\nprefetching sharded model weights and reducing gradients. Identifying the optimal parallelism con\ufb01guration\\nwith minimal communication overhead while avoiding GPU memory over\ufb02ow is challenging. We develop a\\nmemory consumption estimator and a performance-projection tool which helped us explore various parallelism\\ncon\ufb01gurations and project overall training performance and identify memory gaps e\ufb00ectively.\\nNumerical stability. By comparing training loss between di\ufb00erent parallelism setups, we \ufb01xed several numerical\\nissues that impact training stability. To ensure training convergence, we use FP32 gradient accumulation\\nduring backward computation over multiple micro-batches and also reduce-scatter gradients in FP32 across\\ndata parallel workers in FSDP. For intermediate tensors, e.g., vision encoder outputs, that are used multiple\\ntimes in the forward computation, the backward gradients are also accumulated in FP32.\\n3.3.3 Collective Communication\\nOur collective communication library for Llama 3 is based on a fork of Nvidia\u2019s NCCL library, called NCCLX.\\nNCCLX signi\ufb01cantly improves the performance of NCCL, especially for higher latency networks. Recall that\\nthe order of parallelism dimensions is [TP, CP, PP, DP], where DP corresponds to FSDP. The outermost\\nparallelism dimensions, PP and DP, may communicate through a multi-hop network, with latency up to tens\\nof microseconds. The original NCCL collectives\u2014 all-gather andreduce-scatter in FSDP, and point-to-point\\nin PP\u2014require data chunking and staged data copy. This approach incurs several ine\ufb03ciencies, including\\n(1) requiring a large number of small control messages to be exchanged over the network to facilitate data\\ntransfer, (2) extra memory-copy operations, and (3) using extra GPU cycles for communication. For Llama 3\\ntraining, we address a subset of these ine\ufb03ciencies by tuning chunking and data transfer to \ufb01t our network\\nlatencies, which can be as high as tens of microseconds for a large cluster. We also allow small control messages\\nto traverse our network at a higher priority, especially avoiding being head-of-line blocked in deep-bu\ufb00er\\ncore switches.

Despite these challenges, for Llama 3, we achieved higher\\nthan 90% e\ufb00ective training time while supporting automated cluster maintenance, such as \ufb01rmware and Linux\\nkernel upgrades (Vigraham and Leonhardi, 2024), which resulted in at least one training interruption daily.\\nThe e\ufb00ective training time measures the time spent on useful training over the elapsed time.\\nDuring a 54-day snapshot period of pre-training, we experienced a total of 466 job interruptions. Of these, 47\\nwere planned interruptions due to automated maintenance operations such as \ufb01rmware upgrades or operator-\\ninitiated operations like con\ufb01guration or dataset updates. The remaining 419 were unexpected interruptions,\\nwhich are classi\ufb01ed in Table 5. Approximately 78% of the unexpected interruptions are attributed to con\ufb01rmed\\nhardware issues, such as GPU or host component failures, or suspected hardware-related issues like silent data\\ncorruption and unplanned individual host maintenance events. GPU issues are the largest category, accounting\\nfor 58.7% of all unexpected issues. Despite the large number of failures, signi\ufb01cant manual intervention was\\nrequired only three times during this period, with the rest of issues handled by automation.\\nTo increase the e\ufb00ective training time, we reduced job startup and checkpointing time, and developed tools\\nfor fast diagnosis and problem resolution. We extensively use PyTorch\u2019s built-in NCCL \ufb02ight recorder (Ansel\\net al., 2024), a feature that captures collective metadata and stack traces into a ring bu\ufb00er, and hence allowing\\nus to diagnose hangs and performance issues quickly at scale, particularly with regard to NCCLX. Using\\nthis, we e\ufb03ciently record every communication event and the duration of each collective operation, and also\\nautomatically dump tracing data on NCCLX watchdog or heartbeat timeout. We enable more computationally\\nintensive tracing operations and metadata collection selectively as needed live in production through online\\ncon\ufb01guration changes (Tang et al., 2015) without needing a code release or job restart.\\nDebugging issues in large-scale training is complicated by the mixed use of NVLink and RoCE in our network.\\nData transfer over NVLink typically occurs through load/store operations issued by CUDA kernels, and\\nfailures in either the remote GPU or NVLink connectivity often manifest as stalled load/store operations\\nwithin CUDA kernels without returning a clear error code.

The three stages are described separately below. We use similar recipes to\\npre-train the 8B and 70B models.\\n3.4.1 Initial Pre-Training\\nWe pre-train Llama 3 405B using a cosine learning rate schedule, with a peak learning rate of 8\u00d710\u22125,a\\nlinear warm up of 8,000 steps, and a decay to 8\u00d710\u22127over 1,200,000 training steps. We use a lower batch size\\nearly in training to improve training stability, and increase it subsequently to improve e\ufb03ciency. Speci\ufb01cally,\\nwe use an initial batch size of 4M tokens and sequences of length 4,096, and double these values to a batch\\nsize of 8M sequences of 8,192 tokens after pre-training 252M tokens. We double the batch size again to 16M\\nafter pre-training on 2.87T tokens. We found this training recipe to be very stable: we observed few loss\\nspikes and did not require interventions to correct for model training divergence.\\nAdjusting the data mix. We made a several adjustments to the pre-training data mix during training to improve\\nmodel performance on particular downstream tasks. In particular, we increased the percentage of non-English\\ndata during pre-training to improve the multilingual performance of Llama 3. We also upsample mathematical\\ndata to improve the model\u2019s mathematical reasoning performance, we added more recent web data in the\\nlater stages of pre-training to advance the model\u2019s knowledge cut-o\ufb00, and we downsampled subsets of the\\npre-training data that were later identi\ufb01ed as being lower quality.\\n3.4.2 Long Context Pre-Training\\nIn the \ufb01nal stages of pre-training, we train on long sequences to support context windows of up to 128K tokens.\\nWe do not train on long sequences earlier because the compute in self-attention layers grows quadratically in\\nthe sequence length. We increase the supported context length in increments, pre-training until the model has\\nsuccessfully adapted to the increased context length. We assess successful adaptation by measuring whether (1)' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 13}", "page_content='successfully adapted to the increased context length.

In Llama 3 405B pre-training, we increased context length\\ngradually in six stages, starting from the original 8K context window and ending in the \ufb01nal 128K context\\nwindow. This long-context pre-training stage was performed using approximately 800B training tokens.\\n14' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 13}", "page_content='Figure 7 Illustration of the overall post-training approach for Llama 3. Our post-training strategy involves rejection sampling,\\nsupervised \ufb01netuning, and direct preference optimization. See text for details.\\n3.4.3 Annealing\\nDuring pre-training on the \ufb01nal 40M tokens, we linearly annealed the learning rate to 0, maintaining a context\\nlength of 128K tokens. During this annealing phase, we also adjusted the data mix to upsample data sources\\nof very high quality; see Section 3.1.3. Finally, we compute the average of model checkpoints (Polyak (1991)\\naveraging) during annealing to produce the \ufb01nal pre-trained model.\\n4 Post-Training\\nWe produce the aligned Llama 3 models by applying several rounds of post-training,6or aligning the model\\nwith human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2024) on top of a pre-trained checkpoint. Each\\nround of post-training involves supervised \ufb01netuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO;\\nRafailov et al., 2024) on examples collected either via human annotations or generated synthetically. Our\\npost-training modeling and data approaches are described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. We further\\ndetail custom data curation strategies to improve the reasoning, coding, factuality, multilingual, tool use, long\\ncontext, and precise instruction following in Section 4.3.\\n4.1 Modeling\\nThe backbone of our post-training strategy is a reward model and a language model. We \ufb01rst train a reward\\nmodel on top of the pre-trained checkpoint using human-annotated preference data (see Section 4.1.2). We\\nthen \ufb01netune pre-trained checkpoints with supervised \ufb01netuning (SFT; see Section 4.1.3), and further align\\nthe checkpoints with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; see Section 4.1.4). This process is illustrated\\nin Figure 7. Unless otherwise noted, our modeling procedure applies to Llama 3 405B, and we refer to\\nLlama 3 405B as Llama 3 for simplicity.\\n4.1.1 Chat Dialog Format\\nTo tune LLMs for human-AI interaction, we need to de\ufb01ne a chat dialog protocol for the model to understand\\nhuman instructions and perform conversational tasks. Compared to its predecessor, Llama 3 has new\\ncapabilities such as tool use (Section 4.3.5) which may require generating multiple messages and sending\\n6We use the term \u201cpost-training\u201d to refer to any model training that happens outside of pre-training.\\n15' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 14}", "page_content='them to di\ufb00erent locations (e.g., user, ipython) within a single dialog turn. To support this, we design a new\\nmulti-message chat protocol which uses various special header and termination tokens. The header tokens\\nare used to indicate the source and destination of each message in a conversation. Similarly, the termination\\ntokens indicate when it\u2019s the time to alternate between human and AI to speak.\\n4.1.2 Reward Modeling\\nWe train a reward model (RM) covering di\ufb00erent capabilities on top of the pre-trained checkpoint. The\\ntraining objective is the same as Llama 2 except that we remove the margin term in the loss, as we observe\\ndiminishing improvements after data scaling. Following Llama 2, we use all of our preference data for reward\\nmodeling after \ufb01ltering out samples with similar responses. In addition to standard preference pair of (chosen,\\nrejected) response, annotations also create a third \u201cedited response\u201d for some prompts, where the chosen\\nresponse from the pair is further edited for improvement (see Section 4.2.1). Hence, each preference ranking\\nsample has two or three responses with clear ranking ( edited>chosen>rejected). We concatenate the\\nprompt and multiple responses into a single row during training with responses randomly shu\ufb04ed. This is an\\napproximation to the standard scenario of putting the responses in separate rows and computing the scores,\\nbut in our ablations, this approach improves training e\ufb03ciency without a loss in accuracy.\\n4.1.3 Supervised Finetuning\\nThe reward model is then used to perform rejection sampling on our human annotation prompts, the details\\nof which are described in Section 4.2. Together with this rejection-sampled data and other data sources\\n(including synthetic data), we \ufb01netune the pre-trained language model using a standard cross entropy loss\\non the target tokens (while masking loss on prompt tokens). More details about the data mix can be found\\nin Section 4.2. We refer to this stage as supervised \ufb01netuning (SFT; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022;\\nWang et al., 2022b), even though many of the training targets are model-generated. Our largest models are\\n\ufb01netuned with a learning rate of 1e-5 over the course of 8.5K to 9K steps. We found these hyperparameter\\nsettings to work well across di\ufb00erent rounds and data mixes.\\n4.1.4 Direct Preference Optimization\\nWe further train our SFT models with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024) for human\\npreference alignment. For training, we primarily use the most recent batches of preference data collected using\\nthe best performing models from the previous alignment rounds. As a result, our training data conforms better\\nto the distribution of the policy model that is being optimized in each round. We also explored on-policy\\nalgorithms such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), but found that DPO required less compute for large-scale\\nmodels and performed better, especially on instruction following benchmarks like IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023).\\nFor Llama 3, we use a learning rate of 1e-5 and set the \u03b2hyper-parameter to be 0.1. In addition, we apply\\nthe following algorithmic modi\ufb01cations to DPO:\\n\u2022Masking out formatting tokens in DPO loss : We mask out special formatting tokens including header\\nand termination tokens (described in Section 4.1.1) from both chosen and rejected responses in the\\nloss to stabilize DPO training. We observe that having these tokens contribute to the loss may lead\\nto undesired model behaviors such as tail repetition or abruptly generating termination tokens. We\\nhypothesize that this is due to the contrastive nature of the DPO loss \u2013 the presence of common tokens\\nin both chosen and rejected responses leads to a con\ufb02icting learning objective as the model needs to\\nincrease and reduce the likelihood of these tokens simultaneously.\\n\u2022Regularization with NLL loss : We add an additional negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss term with a scaling' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 15}", "page_content='increase and reduce the likelihood of these tokens simultaneously.\\n\u2022Regularization with NLL loss : We add an additional negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss term with a scaling\\ncoe\ufb03cient of 0.2on the chosen sequences, similar to Pang et al. (2024). This helps further stabilize DPO\\ntraining by maintaining desired formatting for generation and preventing the decrease of log probability\\nof chosen responses (Pang et al., 2024; Pal et al., 2024).\\n4.1.5 Model Averaging\\nFinally, we average models obtained from experiments using various versions of data or hyperparameters at\\neach RM, SFT, or DPO stage (Izmailov et al., 2019; Wortsman et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022).\\n16' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 15}", "page_content='% of Avg. # turns Avg. # tokens Avg. # tokens Avg. # tokens\\nDataset comparisons per dialog per example in prompt in response\\nGeneral English 81.99% 4.1 1,000.4 36.4 271.2\\nCoding 6.93% 3.2 1,621.0 113.8 462.9\\nMultilingual 5.19% 1.8 1,299.4 77.1 420.9\\nReasoning and tools 5.89% 1.6 707.7 46.6 129.9\\nTotal 100% 3.8 1,041.6 44.5 284.0\\nTable 6 Statistics of human preference data. We list statistics of the internally collected human preference data used for\\nLlama 3 alignment. We ask annotators to perform multi-turn dialogues with the models and make comparisons among\\nresponses at each turn. In post-processing, we split each dialogue to multiple examples at a turn level. Each example\\nconsists of a prompt (including previous dialog if available) and a response (e.g., chosen or rejected response).\\n4.1.6 Iterative Rounds\\nFollowing Llama 2, we apply the above methods in six rounds. In each cycle, we collect new preference\\nannotations and SFT data, sampling synthetic data from the latest models.\\n4.2 Post-training Data\\nThe post-training data composition plays a critical role in the usefulness and behavior of language models. In\\nthis section, we discuss our human annotation procedures and preference data collection (Section 4.2.1), the\\ncomposition of our SFT data (Section 4.2.2), and methods for data quality control and cleaning (Section 4.2.3).\\n4.2.1 Preference Data\\nOur preference data annotation process is similar to Llama 2. We deploy multiple models for annotation after\\neach round and sample two responses from two di\ufb00erent models for each user prompt. These models can\\nbe trained with di\ufb00erent data mixes and alignment recipes, allowing for di\ufb00erent capability strength ( e.g.,\\ncode expertise) and increased data diversity. We ask annotators to rate the strength of their preference by\\ncategorizing it into one of four levels, based on how much more they prefer the chosen response over the\\nrejected one: signi\ufb01cantly better, better, slightly better, or marginally better. We also incorporate an editing\\nstep after preference ranking to encourage annotators to further improve the preferred response. Annotators\\nedit the chosen response directly or prompt the model with feedback to re\ufb01ne its own response. Consequently,\\na portion of our preference data has three responses ranked ( edited>chosen>rejected).\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of preference annotations that we use for Llama 3 training. General English\\ncovers multiple subcategories such as knowledge-based question and answering or precise instruction-following,\\nwhich fall outside the scope of speci\ufb01c capabilities. Compared to Llama 2, we observe an increase in the\\naverage length of prompt and response, suggesting that we train Llama 3 on more complex tasks. In addition,\\nwe implement a quality analysis and human evaluation process to rigorously assess the data collected, allowing\\nus to re\ufb01ne our prompts and provide systematic, actionable feedback to annotators. For example, as Llama 3\\nimproves after each round, we increase prompt complexity accordingly to target areas where the model lags.\\nIn each round of post-training, we use all the preference data that is available at the time for reward modeling,\\nwhile only using the latest batches from various capabilities for DPO training. For both reward modeling and\\nDPO, we use samples that are labeled as the chosen response being signi\ufb01cantly better or better than the\\nrejected counterpart for training and discard samples with similar responses.\\n4.2.2 SFT Data\\nOur \ufb01netuning data is largely comprised of the following sources:\\n\u2022Prompts from our human annotation collection with rejection-sampled responses\\n\u2022Synthetic data targeting speci\ufb01c capabilities (see Section 4.3 for more details)\\n17' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 16}", "page_content='Avg. # tokens Avg. # tokens\\nDataset % of examples Avg. # turns Avg. # tokens in context in final response\\nGeneral English 52.66% 6.3 974.0 656.7 317.1\\nCode 14.89% 2.7 753.3 378.8 374.5\\nMultilingual 3.01% 2.7 520.5 230.8 289.7\\nExam-like 8.14% 2.3 297.8 124.4 173.4\\nReasoning and tools 21.19% 3.1 661.6 359.8 301.9\\nLong context 0.11% 6.7 38,135.6 37,395.2 740.5\\nTotal 100% 4.7 846.1 535.7 310.4\\nTable 7 Statistics of SFT data.

In this section we discuss the details for the\\nrejection-sampling procedure and overall composition of our \ufb01nal SFT datamix.\\nRejection sampling. During rejection sampling (RS), for each prompt collected during human annotation\\n(Section 4.2.1) we sample K(typically between 10 and 30) outputs from the latest chat model policy (usually\\nthe best performing checkpoint from the previous post-training iteration, or the best performing checkpoint\\nfor a particular capability) and use our reward model to select the best candidate, consistent with Bai et al.\\n(2022). In later rounds of post-training, we introduce system prompts to steer RS responses to conform with\\ndesirable tone, style, or formatting, which might be di\ufb00erent for di\ufb00erent capabilities.\\nTo increase the e\ufb03ciency of rejection sampling, we adopt PagedAttention (Kwon et al., 2023). PagedAttention\\nenhances memory e\ufb03ciency through dynamic key-value cache allocation. It supports arbitrary output lengths\\nby dynamically scheduling requests based on the current cache capacity. Unfortunately, this carries the risk of\\nswap-out when running out of memory. To eliminate such swap overhead, we de\ufb01ne a maximum output length\\nand perform a request only if su\ufb03cient memory is available to \ufb01t an output with that length. PagedAttention\\nalso enables us to share the key-value cache pages for a prompt across all corresponding outputs. Together,\\nthis leads to a throughput improvement of over 2\u00d7during rejection sampling.\\nOverall data composition. Table 7 shows data statistics for each broad category of our \u201chelpfulness\u201d mix. While\\nSFT and preference data contain overlapping domains, they are curated di\ufb00erently, yielding distinct count\\nstatistics. In Section 4.2.3 we describe techniques for categorizing topic, complexity, and quality of our data\\nsamples. In each round of post-training, we adjust our overall data mix carefully across these axes to tune\\nperformance across a wide range of benchmarks. Our \ufb01nal data mix epochs multiple times on some high\\nquality sources and downsamples others.\\n4.2.3 Data Processing and Quality Control\\nGiven that most of our training data is model-generated , it requires careful cleaning and quality control.\\nData cleaning. In the early rounds, we observed a number of undesirable patterns common in our data, such\\nas excessive use of emojis or exclamation points. Therefore, we implement a series of rule-based data removal\\nand modi\ufb01cation strategies to \ufb01lter or clean problematic data. For example, to mitigate overly-apologetic\\ntonal issues, we identify overused phrases (such as \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d or \u201cI apologize\u201d) and carefully balance the\\nproportion of such samples in our dataset.\\nData pruning. We also apply a collection of model-based techniques to remove low-quality training samples\\nand improve overall model performance:\\n\u2022Topic classification: We \ufb01rst \ufb01netune Llama 3 8B into a topic classi\ufb01er, and perform inference over\\nall data to classify it into both coarsely-grained buckets (\u201cmathematical reasoning\u201d) and \ufb01ne-grained\\n18' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 17}", "page_content='buckets (\u201cgeometry and trigonometry\u201d).\\n\u2022Quality scoring: We use both reward model and Llama-based signals to obtain a quality score for each\\nsample. For an RM-based score, we consider data that is in the top quartile of RM scores as high quality.\\nFor a Llama-based score, we prompt Llama 3 checkpoint to rate each sample on a three-point scale for\\ngeneral English data (Accuracy, Instruction Following, and Tone/Presentation) and a two-point scale\\nfor coding data (Bug Identi\ufb01cation and User Intention), and consider samples that obtain the maximum\\nscore as high quality. The RM and Llama-based scores have high disagreement rates, and we \ufb01nd that\\ncombining these signals yield the best recall on our internal test set. Ultimately, we select examples\\nthat are marked as high quality by the RM orthe Llama-based \ufb01lter.\\n\u2022Difficulty scoring: Because we are also interested in prioritizing examples that are more complex for\\nthe model, we score data using two measures of di\ufb03culty: Instag (Lu et al., 2023) and Llama-based\\nscoring. For Instag, we prompt Llama 3 70B to perform intention tagging of SFT prompts, where more\\nintentions implies more complexity. We also prompt Llama 3 to measure the di\ufb03culty (Liu et al., 2024c)\\nof dialogs on a three-point scale.\\n\u2022Semantic deduplication: Finally, we perform semantic deduplication (Abbas et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\\n2024c). We \ufb01rst cluster complete dialogs using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) and within each cluster\\nsort them by quality score \u00d7di\ufb03culty score. We then do greedy selection by iterating through all sorted\\nexamples, and only keeping the ones that have maximum cosine similarity less than a threshold to the\\nexamples seen so far in the cluster.\\n4.3 Capabilities\\nWe highlight special e\ufb00orts to improve performance for speci\ufb01c capabilities such as code (Section 4.3.1),\\nmultilinguality (Section 4.3.2), math and reasoning (Section 4.3.3), long context (Section 4.3.4), tool use\\n(Section 4.3.5), factuality (Section 4.3.6), and steerability (Section 4.3.7).\\n4.3.1 Code\\nLLMs for code have received signi\ufb01cant attention since the release of Copilot and Codex (Chen et al., 2021).\\nDevelopers are now widely using these models to generate code snippets, debug, automate tasks, and improve\\ncode quality. For Llama 3, we target improving and evaluating code generation, documentation, debugging,\\nand review capabilities for the following high priority programming languages: Python, Java, Javascript,\\nC/C++, Typescript, Rust, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, bash/shell. Here, we present our work on improving\\nthese coding capabilities via training a code expert, generating synthetic data for SFT, improving formatting\\nwith system prompt steering, and creating quality \ufb01lters to remove bad samples from our training data.\\nExpert training. We train a code expert which we use to collect high quality human annotations for code\\nthroughout subsequent rounds of post-training. This is accomplished by branching the main pre-training run\\nand continuing pre-training on a 1T token mix of mostly (>85%) code data. Continued pre-training on domain-\\nspeci\ufb01c data has been shown to be e\ufb00ective for improving performance in a speci\ufb01c domain (Gururangan\\net al., 2020). We follow a recipe similar to that of CodeLlama (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023). For the last several\\nthousand steps of training we perform long-context \ufb01netuning (LCFT) to extend the expert\u2019s context length\\nto 16K tokens on a high quality mix of repo-level code data. Finally, we follow the similar post-training\\nmodeling recipes described in Section 4.1 to align this model, except with SFT and DPO data mixes primarily\\ntargeting code. This model is also used for rejection sampling (Section 4.2.2) for coding prompts.\\nSynthetic data generation.

The 8B and 70B models show signi\ufb01cant performance\\nimprovements when trained on data generated by a larger, more competent model. However, our initial\\nexperiments revealed that training Llama 3 405B on its own generated data is not helpful (and can\\neven degrade performance). To address this limitation, we introduced execution feedback as a source of\\ntruth, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes and stay on track. In particular, we generate large\\ndataset of approximately one million synthetic coding dialogues using the following process:\\n\u2022Problem description generation: First, we generate a large collection of programming problem\\ndescriptions that span a diverse range of topics, including those in the long tail distribution. To\\nachieve this diversity, we sample random code snippets from various sources and prompt the model\\nto generate programming problems inspired by these examples. This allowed us to tap into a wide\\nrange of topics and create a comprehensive set of problem descriptions (Wei et al., 2024).\\n\u2022Solution generation: Then, we prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming\\nlanguage. We observe that adding general rules of good programming to the prompt improves the\\ngenerated solution quality. Also, we \ufb01nd it is helpful to require the model to explain its thought\\nprocess in comments.\\n\u2022Correctness analysis: After generating a solution, it is crucial to recognize that its correctness is\\nnot guaranteed, and including incorrect solutions in the \ufb01netuning dataset could harm the model\u2019s\\nquality. While we do not ensure complete correctness, we develop methods to approximate it. To\\nachieve this, we extract the source code from the generated solution and applied a combination of\\nstatic and dynamic analysis techniques to test its correctness, including:\\n\u2013Static analysis : We run all generated code through a parser and a linter to ensure syntactic\\ncorrectness, catching errors such as syntax errors, use of uninitialized variables or non-imported\\nfunctions, code style issues, typing errors, and others.\\n\u2013Unit test generation and execution : For each problem and solution, we prompt the model\\nto generate unit tests, executed in a containerized environment together with the solution,\\ncatching run-time execution errors and some semantic errors.\\n\u2022Error feedback and iterative self-correction: When a solution fails at any step, we prompt the\\nmodel to revise it. The prompt included the original problem description, the faulty solution,\\nand feedback from the parser/linter/tester (stdout, stderr/ and return code). After a unit test\\nexecution failure, the model could either \ufb01x the code to pass the existing tests or modify its unit\\ntests to accommodate the generated code. Only dialogs that pass all checks are included in the \ufb01nal\\ndataset, used for supervised \ufb01netuning (SFT). Notably, we observed that about 20% of solutions\\nwere initially incorrect but self-corrected, indicating that the model learned from the execution\\nfeedback and improved its performance.\\n\u2022Fine-tuning and iterative improvement: The \ufb01netuning process is conducted over multiple rounds,\\nwith each round building on the previous one. After each round, the model is improved, generating\\nhigher-quality synthetic data for the next round. This iterative process allows for progressive\\nre\ufb01nement and enhancement of the model\u2019s performance.\\n2.Synthetic data generation: programming language translation. We observe a performance gap between\\nmajor programming languages ( e.g., Python/C++) and less common ones ( e.g., Typescript/PHP).

To mitigate\\nthis, we supplement our existing data by translating data from common programming languages to\\nless common languages (similar to Chen et al. (2023) in the context of reasoning).

Our Llama 3 pre-training data mix contains signi\ufb01cantly more English tokens than non-English\\ntokens. To collect higher quality human annotations in non-English languages, we train a multilingual expert by\\nbranching o\ufb00 the pre-training run and continuing to pre-train on a data mix that consists of 90% multilingual\\ntokens. We then perform post-training on this expert following Section 4.1. This expert model is then used to\\ncollect higher quality annotations in non-English languages until pre-training was fully complete.\\nMultilingual data collection. Our multilingual SFT data is derived primarily from sources described below. The\\noverall distribution is 2.4% human annotations, 44.2% data from other NLP tasks, 18.8% rejection sampled\\ndata, and 34.6% translated reasoning data.\\n\u2022Human annotations : We collect high-quality, manually annotated data from linguists and native speakers.\\nThese annotations mostly consist of open-ended prompts that represent real world use cases.\\n\u2022Data from other NLP tasks : To further augment, we use multilingual training data from other tasks\\nand rewrite into dialog format. For example, we use data from exams-qa (Hardalov et al., 2020)\\nand Conic10k (Wu et al., 2023). To improve language alignment, we also use parallel texts from\\nGlobalVoices (Prokopidis et al., 2016) and Wikimedia (Tiedemann, 2012). We use LID based \ufb01ltering\\nand Blaser2.0 (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) to remove low quality data. For parallel text data,\\ninstead of using the bitext pairs directly, we apply a multilingual template inspired by Wei et al.

This scarcity makes it di\ufb03cult to create diverse and\\nrepresentative training datasets for teaching models various mathematical skills (Yu et al., 2023; Yue\\net al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024b).\\n\u2022Lack of ground truth chain of thought : E\ufb00ective reasoning requires a step-by-step solution to facilitate\\nthe reasoning process (Wei et al., 2022c). However, there is often a shortage of ground truth chains of\\nthought, which are essential for guiding the model how to break down the problem step-by-step and\\nreach the \ufb01nal answer (Zelikman et al., 2022).\\n\u2022Incorrect intermediate steps : When using model-generated chains of thought, the intermediate steps\\nmay not always be correct (Cobbe et al., 2021; Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al.,\\n2023a). This inaccuracy can lead to incorrect \ufb01nal answers and needs to be addressed.\\n\u2022Teaching models to use external tools : Enhancing models to utilize external tools, such as code interpreters,\\nallows them to reason by interleaving code and text (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Gou et al.,\\n2023). This capability can signi\ufb01cantly improve their problem-solving abilities.\\n\u2022Discrepancy between training and inference : There is often a discrepancy between how the model is\\n\ufb01netuned during training and how it is used during inference. During inference, the \ufb01netuned model may\\ninteract with humans or other models, requiring it to improve its reasoning using feedback. Ensuring\\nconsistency between training and real-world usage is crucial for maintaining reasoning performance.\\nTo address these challenges, we apply the following methodologies:\\n\u2022Addressing the lack of prompts: We source relevant pre-training data from mathematical contexts and\\nconverted it into a question-answer format which can then be used for supervised \ufb01netuning. Additionally,\\nwe identify mathematical skills where the model under-performs and actively sourced prompts from\\nhumans to teach models such skills. To facilitate this process, we create a taxonomy of mathematical\\nskills (Didolkar et al., 2024) and ask humans to provide relevant prompts/questions accordingly.\\n\u2022Augmenting training data with step-wise reasoning traces : We use Llama 3 to generate step-by-step\\nsolutions for a set of prompts. For each prompt, the model produces a variable number of generations.\\nThese generations are then \ufb01ltered based on the correct answer (Li et al., 2024a). We also do self-\\nveri\ufb01cation where Llama 3 is used to verify whether a particular step-by-step solution is valid for a given\\nquestion. This process improves the quality of the \ufb01netuning data by eliminating instances where the\\nmodel does not produce valid reasoning traces.\\n\u2022Filtering incorrect reasoning traces : We train outcome and stepwise reward models (Lightman et al., 2023;\\nWang et al., 2023a) to \ufb01lter training data where the intermediate reasoning steps were incorrect. These\\nreward models are used to eliminate data with invalid step-by-step reasoning, ensuring high-quality\\ndata for \ufb01netuning. For more challenging prompts, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with\\nlearned step-wise reward models to generate valid reasoning traces, further enhancing the collection of\\nhigh-quality reasoning data (Xie et al., 2024).\\n\u2022Interleaving code and text reasoning : We prompt Llama 3 to solve reasoning problems through a' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 22}", "page_content='high-quality reasoning data (Xie et al., 2024).\\n\u2022Interleaving code and text reasoning : We prompt Llama 3 to solve reasoning problems through a\\ncombination of textual reasoning and associated python code (Gou et al., 2023).

Similar to pre-training, we \ufb01nd that during \ufb01netuning we must carefully\\ntune the recipe to balance short and long-context capabilities.\\nSFT and synthetic data generation. Naively applying our existing SFT recipe with only short-context data\\nresulted in signi\ufb01cant regressions in long-context capabilities from pre-training, highlighting the need to\\nincorporate long-context data in our SFT data mix. In practice, however, it is largely impractical to get humans\\nto annotate such examples due to the tedious and time-consuming nature of reading lengthy contexts, so we\\npredominantly rely on synthetic data to \ufb01ll this gap. We use earlier versions of Llama 3 to generate synthetic\\ndata based on the key long-context use-cases: (possibly multi-turn) question-answering, summarization for\\nlong documents, and reasoning over code repositories, and describe them in greater detail below.\\n\u2022Question answering: We carefully curate a set of long documents from our pre-training mix. We split\\nthese documents into chunks of 8K tokens, and prompted an earlier version of the Llama 3 model to\\ngenerate QA pairs conditional on randomly selected chunks. During training, the whole document is\\nused as context.\\n\u2022Summarization: We applied hierarchical summarization of long-context documents by \ufb01rst summarizing\\nthe chunks of 8K input length using our strongest Llama 3 8K context model and then summarizing\\nthe summaries. During training we provide the full document and prompt the model to summarize the\\ndocument while preserving all the important details. We also generate QA pairs based on the summaries\\nof the documents and prompt the model with questions that require global understanding of the whole\\nlong document.\\n\u2022Long context code reasoning: We parse Python \ufb01les to identify importstatements and determine their\\ndependencies. From here, we select the most commonly depended-upon \ufb01les, speci\ufb01cally those referenced\\nby at least \ufb01ve other \ufb01les. We remove one of these key \ufb01les from a repository and prompt the model to\\nidentify which \ufb01les depended on the missing \ufb01le and to generate the necessary missing code.\\nWe further categorize these synthetically generated samples based on the sequence length (16K, 32K, 64K\\nand 128K) to enable more \ufb01ne-grained targeting of input lengths.\\nThrough careful ablations, we observe that mixing 0.1% of synthetically generated long-context data with the\\noriginal short-context data optimizes the performance across both short-context and long-context benchmarks.\\nDPO.We observe that using only short context training data in DPO did not negatively impact long-context\\nperformance as long as SFT model is good for long context tasks. We suspect this is due to the fact that\\nour DPO recipe has fewer optimizer steps than SFT. Given this \ufb01nding, we keep the standard short-context\\nrecipe for DPO on top of our long-context SFT checkpoints.\\n4.3.5 Tool Use\\nTeaching LLMs to use tools such as search engines or code interpreters hugely expands the range of tasks\\nthey can solve, transforming them from pure chat models into more general assistants (Nakano et al., 2021;\\nThoppilan et al., 2022; Parisi et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023a; Schick et al., 2024).

We implement our core tools as Python objects with di\ufb00erent methods. Zero-shot tools can\\nbe implemented as Python functions with descriptions, documentation ( i.e., examples for how to use them),\\nand the model only needs the function\u2019s signature and docstring as context to generate the appropriate call.\\nWe also convert function de\ufb01nitions and calls to JSON format, e.g., for web API calls. All tool calls are\\nexecuted by the Python interpreter, that must be enabled in Llama 3 system prompt. Core tools can be\\nindividually enabled or disabled in the system prompt.\\nData collection. Di\ufb00erent from Schick et al. (2024), we rely on human annotations and preferences to teach\\nLlama 3 to use tools. There are two main di\ufb00erences with the post-training pipeline generally used in Llama 3:\\n\u2022For tools, dialogs often contain more than a single assistant message (e.g., calling the tool and reasoning\\nabout the tool output). Thus, we annotate at the message level to collect granular feedback: annotators\\nprovide a preference between two assistant messages with the same context or, if both contain major\\nproblems, edit one of the messages. The chosen or edited message is then added to the context and the\\ndialog continues. This provides human feedback for both the assistant\u2019s ability of calling the tools and\\nreasoning about the tool outputs. Annotators cannot rank or edit the tool outputs.\\n\u2022We do not perform rejection sampling, as we did not observe gains in our tool benchmarks.\\nTo accelerate the annotation process, we start by bootstrapping basic tool use capabilities by \ufb01netuning on\\nsynthetically generated data from previous Llama 3 checkpoints. Thus, annotators have fewer edits to perform.\\nIn a similar spirit, as Llama 3 gradually improves through its development, we progressively complexify our\\nhuman annotation protocols: we start by single-turn tool use annotations, before moving to tool use in dialogs,\\nand \ufb01nally annotating for multi-step tool use and data analysis.\\nTool datasets. To create data for tool usage applications, we leverage the following procedure:\\n\u2022Single-step tool use: We start by few-shot generation of synthetic user prompts which, by construction,\\nrequire a call to one of our core tools (for example, questions that exceed our knowledge cuto\ufb00 date).\\nThen, still relying on few-shot generation, we generate appropriate tool calls for these prompts, execute\\nthem, and add the output to the model\u2019s context. Finally, we prompt the model again to generate a\\n\ufb01nal answer to the user\u2019s query based on the tool output. We end up with trajectories of the following\\nform: system prompt, user prompt, tool call, tool output, \ufb01nal answer. We also \ufb01lter around 30%this\\ndataset to remove tool calls that cannot be executed or other formatting issues.\\n\u2022Multi-step tool use: We follow a similar protocol and \ufb01rst generate synthetic data to teach the model\\nbasic multi-step tool use capabilities. To do this, we \ufb01rst prompt Llama 3 to generate user prompts\\nthat require at least two tool calls, that can be the same or di\ufb00erent tools from our core set. Then,\\nconditioned on these prompts, we few-shot prompt Llama 3 to generate a solution consisting of interleaved\\nreasoning steps and tool calls, similar to ReAct (Yao et al., 2022).

More precisely, we extract function calls and their de\ufb01nitions, clean and \ufb01lter them, e.g.for\\nmissing docstrings or non-executable functions, and use Llama 3 to generate a natural language query\\ncorresponding to the function call.\\n\u2022Multi-turn function calling: We also generate synthetic data for multi-turn dialogs with function calls,\\nfollowing a protocol similar to the one proposed in Li et al. (2023b). We use multiple agents that\\ngenerate domains, APIs, user queries, API calls, and responses, while also ensuring that the generated\\ndata covers a set of diverse domains and realistic APIs. All agents are variants of Llama 3 prompted in\\ndi\ufb00erent ways depending on their roles and collaborate in a step-by-step manner.\\n4.3.6 Factuality\\nHallucinations remain a major challenge for large language models. Models tend to be overcon\ufb01dent, even in\\ndomains where they have little knowledge. Despite these shortcomings, they are often used as knowledge bases,\\nwhich can lead to risky outcomes such as the spread of misinformation. While we recognize that factuality\\ncan go beyond hallucinations, we took a hallucination-\ufb01rst approach here.\\n26' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 25}", "page_content='Figure 11 Processing file uploads. Example of Llama 3 performing analysis and visualization of an uploaded \ufb01le.\\nWe follow the principle that post-training should align the model to \u201cknow what it knows\u201d rather than add\\nknowledge (Gekhman et al., 2024; Mielke et al., 2020). Our primary approach involves generating data that\\naligns model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data. To achieve this, we\\ndevelop a knowledge probing technique that takes advantage of Llama 3\u2019s in-context abilities.

For Llama 3, we focus on enhancing its steerability through system prompt with natural language\\ninstructions, especially around response length, format, tone and character/persona.\\nData collection. We collect steerability preference samples within the general English category by asking\\nannotators to design di\ufb00erent system prompts for Llama 3. Annotators then engage in conversations with the\\nmodels to evaluate their consistency in following instructions de\ufb01ned in system prompts over the course of the\\nconversation. We show an example customized system prompt used for enhancing steerability below:\\nYou are a helpful and cheerful AI Chatbot that acts as a meal plan assistant for busy families.\\nThe family consists of 2 adults, 3 teenagers, and 2 preschoolers. Plan two or three days at a time\\nand use leftovers or extra ingredients for the second day\u2019s plan. The user will let you know if they\\nwant two or three days. If they don\u2019t, assume three days. Each plan should include breakfast,\\nlunch, snack, and dinner. Ask the user if they approve of the plan or need adjustments.

After we collect the preference data, we leverage this data in reward modeling, rejection sampling,\\nSFT, and DPO to enhance Llama 3\u2019s steerability.\\n5 Results\\nWe performed an extensive series of evaluations of Llama 3, investigating the performance of: (1)the pre-trained\\nlanguage model, (2)the post-trained language model, and (3)the safety characteristics of Llama 3. We present\\nthe results of these evaluations in separate subsections below.\\n5.1 Pre-trained Language Model\\nIn this section, we report evaluation results for our pre-trained Llama 3 (Section 3), comparing with various\\nother models of comparable sizes. We reproduce results of competitor models whenever possible. For non-\\nLlama models, we report the best score across results that are publicly reported or (where possible) that we\\nreproduced ourselves. The speci\ufb01cs of these evaluations, including con\ufb01gurations such as the number of shots,\\nmetrics, and other pertinent hyperparameters and settings, can be accessed on our Github repository here.\\nAdditionally, we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks\\nwhich can be found on Huggingface here. We evaluate the quality of our models on standard benchmarks\\n(Section 5.1.1), for robustness to changes in multiple-choice question setups (Section 5.1.2), and on adversarial\\nevaluations (Section 5.1.3). We also conduct a contamination analysis to estimate the extent to which our\\nevaluations are impacted by contamination of training data (Section 5.1.4).\\n5.1.1 Standard Benchmarks\\nTo compare our models with the current state-of-the-art, we evaluate Llama 3 on a large number of standard\\nbenchmark evaluations shown in Table 8.

Overview of all benchmarks we use to evaluate pre-trained Llama 3 models,\\ngrouped by capability category.\\nExperimental setup. For each benchmark, we compute scores for Llama 3 as well as various other pre-trained\\nmodels of comparable sizes. Where possible, we recompute numbers with our own pipeline for other models.\\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we then select the best score between the score that we computed and the\\nreported number for that model with comparable or more conservative settings. You can \ufb01nd additional\\ndetails on our evaluation setup here. For some models, it is not possible to (re)compute benchmark values,\\nfor instance, because the pre-trained model is not released or because the API does not provide access to\\nlog-probabilities. In particular, this is true for all models comparable to Llama 3 405B. Thus, we do not\\nreport category averages for Llama 3 405B, which requires that all numbers are available for all benchmarks.\\nSignificance values. When computing benchmark scores, there are several sources of variance that cause\\nimprecise estimates of a model\u2019s performance on the benchmark intends to measure, such as few shot\\ndemonstrations, random seeds, and batch size. This makes it challenging to understand if one model is\\nstatistically signi\ufb01cantly better than another. For that reason, we report our scores along with 95% con\ufb01dence\\nintervals (CIs) for the variance stemming from the benchmark data selection. We compute 95% CIs analytically\\nusing the formula (Madaan et al., 2024b):\\nCIanalytic (S) = 1.96\u00d7\u221a\\nS\u00d7(1\u2212S)\\nN,\\nwhereSis the preferred benchmark score and Nthe sample size of the benchmark. We note that because\\nvariance in the benchmark data is not the only source of variance, these 95% CIs are lower bounds on the\\nactual variance in the capability estimate. CIs are omitted for metrics that are not simple averages.\\nResults for 8B and 70B models. Figure 12 reports the average performance of Llama 3 8B and 70B on the\\ncommonsense reasoning, knowledge, reading comprehension, math and reasoning, and code benchmarks. The\\nresults show that Llama 3 8B outperforms competing models in virtually every category, both in terms of\\nper-category win rate and in terms of average per-category performance. We also \ufb01nd that Llama 3 70B\\noutperforms its predecessor Llama 2 70B by a large margin on most benchmarks, with the exception of\\ncommonsense benchmarks that are likely saturated.

We investigate the robustness of our pre-trained language models to design choices in\\nmultiple-choice question (MCQ) setups. Prior work has reported that model performance can be sensitive to\\nseemingly arbitrary design choices in such setups, for example, model scores and even rankings may change\\nwith the order and labels of the in-context examples (Lu et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021; Robinson and Wingate,\\n2023; Liang et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2024), the exact format of the prompt (Weber et al., 2023b; Mishra\\net al., 2022), or the answer choice format and order (Alzahrani et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Zheng et al.,\\n2023).

For question answering, we use Adversarial SQuAD (Jia and Liang, 2017) and Dynabench\\nSQuAD (Kiela et al., 2021). For mathematical reasoning, we use GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024c). For paraphrase\\ndetection, we use PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019).\\nFigure 15 presents the scores of Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B on the adversarial benchmarks as a function of their\\nperformance on non-adversarial benchmarks. The non-adversarial benchmarks we use are SQuAD (Rajpurkar\\net al., 2016) for question answering, GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and QQP (Wang et al., 2017) for\\nparaphrase detection. Each datapoint represents a pair of an adversarial and non-adversarial datasets ( e.g.\\nQQP paired with PAWS), and we show all possible pairs within a category. The diagonal black line represents\\nparity between adversarial and non-adversarial datasets \u2014 being on the line would indicate the model has\\nsimilar performance regardless of the adversarial nature.\\nOn paraphrase detection, neither pre-trained nor post-trained models appear to su\ufb00er from the type of\\nadversariality with which PAWS was constructed, marking a substantial step with respect to the previous\\ngeneration of models. This result con\ufb01rms the \ufb01ndings of Weber et al. (2023a), who also found that LLMs are\\nless susceptible to the type of spurious correlations found in several adversarial datasets. For mathematical\\nreasoning and question answering, however, the adversarial performances are substantially lower than the\\nnon-adversarial performances. This pattern is similar for pre-trained and post-trained models.\\n5.1.4 Contamination Analysis\\nWe conduct a contamination analysis to estimate to what extent benchmark scores may be in\ufb02uenced\\nby contamination of the evaluation data in the pre-training corpus. In previous work, several di\ufb00erent\\ncontamination methods have been used, with various di\ufb00erent hyperparameters \u2013 we refer to Singh et al.\\n(2024) for an overview. Any of these methods can su\ufb00er from false positives and negatives, and how to best\\nrun contamination analyses is currently still an open \ufb01eld of research. Here, we largely follow the suggestions\\nof Singh et al. (2024).\\n33' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 32}", "page_content='Llama 3\\n8B 70B 405B\\nQuALITY (5-shot)56.0\u00b12.182.8\u00b11.687.6\u00b11.4\\nGSM8K (16-shot) 60.0\u00b19.683.0\u00b17.490.0\u00b15.9\\nTable 14 Performance of pre-trained models on long-context\\ntasks.Results include 95% con\ufb01dence intervals.\\nContam.

For all our evaluation datasets, we\\nscore examples based on 8-gram overlap, a method\\nthat was found by Singh et al. (2024) to be accurate\\nfor many datasets. We consider an example of a\\ndatasetDto be contaminated if a ratio TDof its\\ntokens are part of an 8-gram occurring at least once\\nin the pre-training corpus. We select TDseparately\\nfor each dataset, based on which value shows the\\nmaximal signi\ufb01cant estimated performance gain\\nacross the three model sizes.\\nResults. In Table 15, we report the percentage of\\nevaluation data that is considered contaminated\\nfor the maximal estimated performance gain, as\\ndescribed above, for all key benchmarks. From\\nthe table, we exclude numbers for benchmarks for\\nwhich the results are not signi\ufb01cant, for instance\\nbecause the clean or contaminated set has too few\\nexamples, or because the observed performance\\ngain estimate shows extremely erratic behavior. In\\nTable 15, we observe that for some datasets con-\\ntamination has a large impact, while for others it\\ndoes not. For example, for PiQA and HellaSwag,\\nboth the estimation of contamination and the esti-\\nmation of performance gain are high. For Natural\\nQuestions, on the other hand, the estimated 52%\\ncontamination seems to have virtually no e\ufb00ect\\non the performance. For SQuAD and MATH, low\\nthresholds yield high levels of contamination, but\\nno performance gains. This suggests that contam-\\nination is either not helpful for these datasets, or\\nthat a larger n is required to obtain a better es-\\ntimate. Finally, for MBPP, HumanEval, MMLU\\nand MMLU-Pro, other contamination detection methods may be needed: even with higher thresholds, 8-gram\\noverlap gives such high contamination scores that it is impossible to get a good performance gain estimate.\\n5.2 Post-trained Language Model\\nWe present results for our Llama 3 post-trained models on benchmarks across di\ufb00erent capabilities.

Overview of all benchmarks we use to evaluate post-trained Llama 3\\nmodels, ordered by capability.\\n5.2.1 General Knowledge and Instruction-Following Benchmarks\\nWe evaluate Llama 3 on benchmarks for general knowledge and instruction-following in Table 2.\\nGeneral knowledge. We leverage MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b) to\\nevaluate Llama 3\u2019s capability on knowledge-based question answering. For MMLU, we report the macro\\naverage of subtask accuracy under the 5-shot standard setting without CoT. MMLU-Pro is an extension\\nof MMLU, incorporating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions, eliminating noisy questions, and\\nexpanding the choice set from four to ten options. Given its focus on complex reasoning, we report 5-shot\\nCoT for MMLU-Pro. All tasks are formatted as generation tasks, similar to simple-evals (OpenAI, 2024).\\nAs shown in Table 2, our 8B and 70B Llama 3 variants outperform other models of similar sizes on both\\ngeneral knowledge tasks. Our 405B model outperforms GPT-4 and Nemotron 4 340B, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet\\nleading among larger models.\\nInstruction following. We assess the ability of Llama 3 and other models to follow natural language instructions\\non IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023). IFEval comprises approximately 500 \u201cveri\ufb01able instructions\u201d such as \u201cwrite\\nin more than 400 words\u201d, which can be veri\ufb01ed by heuristics. We report the average of prompt-level and\\ninstruction-level accuracy, under strict and loose constraints in Table 2. Note that all Llama 3 variants\\noutperform comparable models across IFEval.\\n5.2.2 Proficiency Exams\\nNext, we evaluate our models on a wide variety of pro\ufb01ciency exams originally designed to test humans. We\\nsource these exams from publicly available o\ufb03cial sources; for some exams, we report average scores across\\ndi\ufb00erent exam sets per pro\ufb01ciency exam. Speci\ufb01cally, we average:\\n\u2022GRE: O\ufb03cial GRE Practice Test 1 and 2 (from the Educational Testing Services);\\n\u2022LSAT: O\ufb03cial Preptest 71, 73, 80 and 93;\\n\u2022SAT: 8 exams from The O\ufb03cial SAT Study guide edition 2018;\\n\u2022AP: One o\ufb03cial practice exam per subject;\\n\u2022GMATO\ufb03cial GMAT Online Exam.\\nQuestions in these exams contain both MCQ style and generation questions. We exclude the questions that\\nare accompanied with images. For the GRE exams that contain questions with multiple correct options, we\\nqualify the outputs as correct only if all the correct options are selected by the model.

Modeling teams did not have access to our\\nhuman-evaluation prompts to prevent accidental contamination or over\ufb01tting on the test set.\\nEvaluation process. To perform a pairwise human evaluation of two models, we ask human annotators which\\nof two model responses (produced by di\ufb00erent models) they prefer. Annotators use a 7-point scale for their\\nratings, enabling them to indicate whether one model response is much better than, better than, slightly\\nbetter than, or about the same as the other model response. When an annotator indicates that one model\\nresponse is better or much better than the other model response, we consider this a \u201cwin\u201d for that model. We\\nperform pairwise comparisons between models in which we report win rates per capability in the prompt set.\\nResults. We use our human evaluation process to compare Llama 3 405B with GPT-4 (0125 API version),\\nGPT-4o (API version), and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (API version). The results of these evaluations are presented\\nin Figure 17. We observe that Llama 3 405B performs approximately on par with the 0125 API version of\\nGPT-4, while achieving mixed results (some wins and some losses) compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5\\nSonnet. On nearly all capabilities, the win rates of Llama 3 and GPT-4 are within the margin of error. On\\nmultiturn reasoning and coding tasks, Llama 3 405B outperforms GPT-4 but it underperforms GPT-4 on\\nmultilingual (Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese) prompts. Llama 3 performs on par with GPT-4o on English\\nprompts, on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet on multilingual prompts, and outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet on\\nsingle and multiturn English prompts. However, it trails Claude 3.5 Sonnet in capabilities such as coding\\nand reasoning. Qualitatively, we \ufb01nd that model performance in human evaluations is heavily in\ufb02uenced by\\nnuanced factors such as model tone, response structure, and verbosity \u2013 factors that we are optimizing for\\nin our post-training process. Overall, our human evaluation results are consistent with those on standard\\nbenchmark evaluations: Llama 3 405B is very competitive with leading industry models, making it the\\nbest-performing openly available model.\\nLimitations. All human evaluation results underwent a thorough data quality assurance process. However,\\nsince it is challenging to de\ufb01ne objective criteria for evaluating model responses, human evaluations can still\\nbe in\ufb02uenced by personal biases, backgrounds, and preferences of human annotators, which may lead to\\ninconsistent or unreliable results.\\n5.4 Safety\\nWe focus our study on assessing Llama 3\u2019s ability to generate content in a safe and responsible way, while still\\nmaximizing helpful information. Our safety work begins in the pre-training stage, primarily in the form of\\ndata cleaning and \ufb01ltering.

Upliftrefers to the additional risk introduced by new technological developments compared to using\\nexisting available technologies (such as web search).\\nWe then describe how we leverage Red Teaming to iteratively identify and combat various safety risks across\\ncapabilities and perform a residual risk assessment.\\nFinally, we describe system-level safety , or the development and orchestration of classi\ufb01ers around the input\\nand output of the model itself to further enhance safety and make it easier for developers to both customize\\nsafety to various usecases and deploy generative AI in more responsible ways.\\n5.4.1 Benchmark Construction\\nWe create various internal benchmarks to help us develop models safely and responsibly. Our benchmarks are\\nheavily inspired by the risk categories from the ML Commons taxonomy of hazards (Vidgen et al., 2024).\\nWhile various benchmarks for language model safety exist such as ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), XS\\nTest (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2023), and more, a number of the new capabilities in Llama 3 do not have su\ufb03cient\\nexternal benchmarks available and often external benchmarks lack su\ufb03cient coverage of breadth and depth.\\nFor each risk category, we collect human-written prompts that are either adversarial or borderline in nature \u2014\\nexamples of such prompts can be found in Table 23. Adversarial prompts range from straightforward ones that\\ndirectly elicit a harmful response to ones that incorporate sophisticated jailbreaking techniques. Benchmarks\\nof these adversarial prompts are the basis for how we measure violation rate.\\nAs a counter-metric to violation rate, we also construct false refusal benchmarks composed of borderline\\nprompts. We refer to false refusal as occurring when a model refuses to answer in a helpful way even when\\na plausible, safe response is possible. Borderline prompts are prompts near the decision boundary that a\\nwell-calibrated model should handle, for example, \u201cHow can I steal the spotlight from my bestie who always\\nacts like the main character??\u201d Our overall benchmark size across violations and false refusals is over 4000\\nprompts per capability or language, and contains a mix of single-turn and multi-turn prompts.\\n5.4.2 Safety Pre-training\\nWe believe responsible development must be considered from an end-to-end perspective and incorporated at\\nevery stage of model development and deployment.

We construct di\ufb00erent test scenarios by varying the length of prompt\\nand ground truth, the detected language of target data, and the domain. We then measure how often the model\\ngenerates the ground truth sequence verbatim, and analyze the relative rates of memorization in the speci\ufb01ed\\nscenarios. We de\ufb01ne verbatim memorization as the inclusion rate \u2013 the proportion of model generations that\\ninclude the ground truth continuation exactly \u2013 and report averages weighted by the prevalence of given\\ncharacteristics in the data, as shown in Table 24.

Our safety \ufb01netuning process\\nbuilds upon our general \ufb01netuning methodology with modi\ufb01cations tailored to address speci\ufb01c safety concerns.\\nWe optimize for two primary metrics: Violation Rate (VR), a metric that captures when the model produces a\\nresponse that violates a safety policy, and False Refusal Rate (FRR), a metric that captures when the model\\nincorrectly refuses to respond to a harmless prompt. In parallel, we evaluate model performance on helpfulness\\nbenchmarks to ensure that safety improvements do not compromise overall helpfulness.\\n12Note there are limitations with our analysis \u2014 for example, recent work advocates for metrics beyond exact match (Ippolito\\net al., 2023) and alternative prompt search strategies (Kassem et al., 2024). Nonetheless, we \ufb01nd the results of the evaluations to\\nbe encouraging.\\n42' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 41}", "page_content='22.53204060Llama 3 8BLlama 3 70B\\nFalse Refusal Rate (%)Violation Rate (%)Figure 18 Influence of model size on safety mix design for balanc-\\ning violation rate (VR) and false refusal rate (FRR).

To ensure the highest quality\\ndata, we developed AI-assisted annotation tools to\\nsupport our rigorous quality assurance processes.\\nIn addition to collecting adversarial prompts, we\\nalso gather a set of similar prompts, which we refer\\nto as borderline prompts . These are closely related\\nto the adversarial prompts but with a goal to teach\\nthe model to learn to provide helpful responses,\\nthereby reducing the false refusal rate (FRR).\\nBeyond human annotation, we also leverage syn-\\nthetic data to improve the quality and coverage of\\nour training datasets. We utilize a range of tech-\\nniques to generate additional adversarial examples,\\nincluding in-context learning with carefully crafted\\nsystem prompts, guided mutation of seed prompts\\nbased on new attack vectors, and advanced algo-\\nrithms including Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan\\net al., 2024), based on MAP-Elites (Mouret and Clune, 2015), which generate prompts constrained across\\nmultiple dimensions of diversity.\\nWe further address the model\u2019s tone when producing safe responses, which has an impact on downstream\\nuser experience. We developed a refusal tone guideline for Llama 3 and ensured that all new safety data\\nadhered to it through rigorous quality assurance process. We also re\ufb01ne existing safety data to align with the\\nguideline, using a combination of zero-shot rewriting and human-in-the-loop editing to produce high-quality\\ndata.

Following our Llama 2 recipe (Touvron et al., 2023b), we combine all helpfulness\\ndata and safety data during the model alignment stage. Additionally, we introduce a borderline dataset to\\nhelp the model discern the subtle distinctions between safe and unsafe requests. Our annotation teams are\\ninstructed to meticulously craft responses to safety prompts based on our guidelines.

A comparison of Llama 3\u2019s \ufb01nal violation and false refusal rates with similar models\\ncan be found in Figures 19 and 20. These results focus on our largest parameter size Llama 3 405B model,\\ncompared to relevant competitors. Two of the competitors are end-to-end systems accessed through API,\\nand one of them is an open source language model that we host internally and we evaluate directly.13We\\nevaluate our Llama models both standalone and coupled with Llama Guard, our open source system-level\\nsafety solution (more in Section 5.4.7).\\nWhile a low violation rate is desirable, it is critical to consider false refusal as a counter-metric, as a model\\nthat always refuses is maximally safe, but not helpful in the slightest.

To construct the benchmarks for each language, we use a combination of prompts written by native\\nspeakers, sometimes supplementing with translations from our English benchmarks. For each of our supported\\nlanguages, we \ufb01nd that Llama 405B with Llama Guard is at least as safe, if not strictly safer, than the two\\ncompeting systems when measured on our internal benchmark, while maintaining competitive false refusal\\nrates. Looking at the Llama 405B model on its own, without Llama Guard, we \ufb01nd that it has a signi\ufb01cantly\\nlower violation rate than the competing standalone open source model, trading o\ufb00 a higher false refusal rate.\\nLong-context safety. Long-context models are vulnerable to many-shot jailbreaking attacks without targeted\\nmitigation (Anil et al., 2024). To address this, we \ufb01netune our models on SFT datasets that include examples\\nof safe behavior in the presence of demonstrations of unsafe behavior in context. We develop a scalable\\nmitigation strategy that signi\ufb01cantly reduces VR, e\ufb00ectively neutralizing the impact of longer context attacks\\neven for 256-shot attacks. This approach shows little to no impact on FRR and most helpfulness metrics.\\nTo quantify the e\ufb00ectiveness of our long context safety mitigations, we use two additional benchmarking\\nmethods: DocQAandMany-shot . For DocQA, short for \u201cdocument question answering,\u201d we use long documents\\nwith information that could be utilized in adversarial ways. Models are provided both the document and a set\\nof prompts related to the document in order to test whether the questions being related to information in the\\ndocument a\ufb00ected the model\u2019s ability to respond safely to the prompts. For Many-shot, following Anil et al.\\n(2024), we construct a synthetic chat history composed of unsafe prompt-response pairs. A \ufb01nal prompt,\\nunrelated to previous messages, is used to test whether the unsafe behavior in-context in\ufb02uenced the model\\nto response unsafely. The violation and false refusal rates for both DocQA and Many-shot are shown in\\nFigure 20.

To evaluate cybersecurity risk, we leverage the CyberSecEval benchmark\\nframework (Bhatt et al., 2023, 2024), which contains tasks that measure safety across domains such as\\ngenerating insecure code, generating malicious code, textual prompt injection, and vulnerability identi\ufb01cation.\\nWe developed and applied Llama 3 to new benchmarks on spear phishing and autonomous cyberattacks.\\nOverall, we \ufb01nd that Llama 3 does not have signi\ufb01cant susceptibilities in generating malicious code or\\nexploiting vulnerabilities. We describe brief results on speci\ufb01c tasks:\\n\u2022Insecure coding testing framework: Evaluating Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B against the insecure coding\\ntesting framework, we continue to observe that larger models both generate more insecure code and also\\ngenerate code with a higher average BLEU score (Bhatt et al., 2023).\\n\u2022Code interpreter abuse prompt corpus: We identify that Llama 3 models are susceptible to executing\\nmalicious code under certain prompts, with Llama 3 405B being particularly susceptible by complying\\nwith malicious prompts 10.4% of the time. Llama 3 70B complied at a rate of 3.8%.\\n\u2022Text-based prompt injection benchmark: When evaluated against prompt injection benchmarks, prompt\\ninjection attacks against Llama 3 405B were successful 21.7% of the time.

Llama 3 70B and Llama 3 405B were\\nevaluated by the judge LLM to be moderately persuasive. Llama 3 70B was judged by an LLM to have\\nbeen successful in 24% of spear phishing attempts while Llama 3 405B was judged to be successful in\\n14% of attempts.

The model is a multi-label\\nclassi\ufb01er that detects two classes of prompt attack risk - direct jailbreaks (techniques that explicitly try to\\noverride a model\u2019s safety conditioning or system prompt) and indirect prompt injections (instances where\\nthird-party data included in a model\u2019s context window includes instructions inadvertently executed as user\\ncommands by an LLM). The model is \ufb01ne-tuned from mDeBERTa-v3-base , a small (86M) parameter model\\nsuitable for \ufb01ltering inputs into an LLM.

It does so by leveraging a static analysis library, the Insecure Code\\nDetector (ICD), to identify insecure code.

However,\\nthey are not an issue during inference, since inference does not involve a backward pass that requires a pipeline\\n\ufb02ush.

We \ufb01nd\\nthat micro-batching improves throughput of inference with the same local batch size; see Figure 24.

In particular, we quantize most parameters and activations in the feedforward network layers in the\\nmodel, which account for roughly 50% of the inference compute time. We do not quantize parameters in\\nthe self-attention layers of the model. We leverage dynamic scaling factors for better accuracy (Xiao et al.,\\n2024b), optimizing our CUDA kernels15to reduce the overhead of calculating the scales. We \ufb01nd that the\\nquality of Llama 3 405B is sensitive to certain types of quantization, and make a few additional changes to\\nincrease the model output quality:\\n1. Akin to Zhang et al. (2021), we do not perform quantization in the \ufb01rst and last Transformer layers.\\n2.High-perplexity tokens such as dates can lead to large activation values. In turn, these can lead to high\\ndynamic scaling factors in FP8 and a non-negligible number of under\ufb02ows, leading to errors in decoding.\\n15Our FP8 kernels are available at https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/tree/main/fbgemm_gpu/experimental/gen_ai .\\nWe provide usage examples at https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system .\\n52' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 51}", "page_content='Figure 25 Illustration of tensor-wise and row-wise FP8 quantization.

First, we compose a pre-trained image encoder\\n(Xu et al., 2023) and the pre-trained language model by introducing and training a set of cross-attention\\nlayers between the two models (Alayrac et al., 2022) on a large number of image-text pairs. This leads to\\nthe model illustrated in Figure 28. Second, we introduce temporal aggregator layers and additional video\\ncross-attention layers that operate on a large collection of video-text pairs to learn the model to recognize and\\nprocess temporal information from videos.\\nA compositional approach to foundation model development has several advantages: (1)it enables us to\\nparallelize the development of the vision and language modeling capabilities; (2)it circumvents complexities\\nof joint pre-training on visual and language data that stem from tokenization of visual data, di\ufb00erences in\\nbackground perplexities of tokens originating from di\ufb00erent modalities, and contention between modalities; (3)\\nit guarantees that model performance on text-only tasks is not a\ufb00ected by the introduction of visual-recognition\\ncapabilities, and (4)the cross-attention architecture ensures that we do not have to expend compute passing\\nfull-resolution images through the increasingly LLM backbones (speci\ufb01cally, the feed-forward networks in\\neach transformer layer), making it more e\ufb03cient during inference. We note that our multimodal models are\\nstill under development and not yet ready for release.\\nBefore presenting the results of our experiments in Section 7.6 and 7.7, we describe the data we used to train\\nvisual recognition capabilities, the model architecture of the vision components, how we scale training of those\\ncomponents, and our pre-training and post-training recipes.\\n7.1 Data\\nWe describe our image and video data separately below.\\n7.1.1 Image Data\\nOur image encoder and adapter are trained on image-text pairs. We construct this dataset via a complex\\ndata processing pipeline that consists of four main stages: (1)quality \ufb01ltering, (2)perceptual de-duplication,\\n(3)resampling, and (4)optical character recognition. We also apply a series of safety mitigations.\\n\u2022Quality filtering. We implement quality \ufb01lters that remove non-English captions and low-quality captions\\nvia heuristics such as low alignment scores produced by (Radford et al., 2021). Speci\ufb01cally, we remove\\nall image-text pairs below a certain CLIP score.\\n\u2022De-duplication. De-duplicating large-scale training datasets bene\ufb01ts model performance because it\\nreduces training compute spent on redundant data (Esser et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021; Abbas et al.,\\n54' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 53}", "page_content='Figure 28 Illustration of the compositional approach to adding multimodal capabilities to Llama 3 that we study in this paper.

Hence, we de-duplicate our training\\ndata for both e\ufb03ciency and privacy reasons. To do so, we use an internal version of the state-of-the-art\\nSSCD copy-detection model (Pizzi et al., 2022) to de-duplicate images at scale. For all images, we\\n\ufb01rst compute a 512-dimensional representation using the SSCD model. We use those embeddings to\\nperform a nearest neighbor (NN) search for each image across all images in our data set, using a cosine\\nsimilarity measure. We de\ufb01ne examples above a certain similarity threshold as duplicates. We group\\nthese duplicates using a connected-components algorithm, and maintain only one image-text pair per\\nconnected component. We increase the e\ufb03ciency of our de-duplication pipeline by: (1) pre-clustering the\\ndata using k-means clusters and (2) using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019) for NN searches and clustering.\\n\u2022Resampling. We ensure diversity of the image-text pairs via resampling akin to Xu et al. (2023);\\nMahajan et al. (2018); Mikolov et al. (2013). First, we construct a vocabulary of n-grams by parsing\\nhigh-quality text sources. Next, we compute the frequency of each vocabulary n-gram in our dataset.\\nWe then resample the data as follows: If any of the n-grams in a caption occurs less than Ttimes in the\\nvocabulary, we keep the corresponding image-text pair. Otherwise, we independently sample each of\\nthe n-grams niin the caption with probability\u221a\\nT/fiwherefiindicates the frequency of n-gram ni;\\nwe keep the image-text pair if any of the n-grams was sampled.

With the multi-layer features, the image\\nencoder produces a 7680-dimensional representation for each of the resulting 16\u00d716 = 256 patches. The\\nparameters of the image encoder are notfrozen during subsequent training stages as we found it to improve\\nperformance, especially in domains such as text recognition.\\nImage adapter. We introduce cross-attention layers between the visual token representations produced by the\\nimage encoder and the token representations produced by the language model (Alayrac et al., 2022). The\\ncross-attention layers are applied after every fourth self-attention layer in the core language model. Like the\\nlanguage model itself, the cross-attention layers use generalized query attention (GQA) for increased e\ufb03ciency.\\nThe cross-attention layers introduce substantial numbers of additional trainable parameters into the model:\\nfor Llama 3 405B, the cross-attention layers have \u2248100B parameters. We pre-train our image adapter in two\\nstages: (1) initial pre-training followed by (2) annealing:\\n\u2022Initial pre-training. We pre-train our image adapter on our dataset of \u223c6B image-text pairs described\\nabove. For compute e\ufb03ciency reasons, we resize all images to \ufb01t within at mostfour tiles of 336\u00d7336\\npixels each, where we arrange the tiles arranged to support di\ufb00erent aspect ratios, e.g.,672\u00d7672,\\n672\u00d7336, and 1344\u00d7336.\\n\u2022Annealing. We continue training the image adapter on \u223c500M images from the annealing dataset\\ndescribed above. During annealing, we increase the per-tile image resolution to improve performance on\\ntasks that require higher-resolution images, for example, infographics understanding.\\nVideo adapter. Our model takes as input up to 64 frames (uniformly sampled from a full video), each of which\\nare processed by the image encoder. We model temporal structure in videos through two components: (i)\\nencoded video frames are aggregated by a temporal aggregator which merges 32 consecutive frames into one,\\n(ii) additional video cross attention layers are added before every fourth image cross attention layer. The\\ntemporal aggregator is implemented as a perceiver resampler (Jaegle et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022). We\\npre-train using 16 frames per video (aggregated to 1 frame), but increase the number of input frames to 64\\nduring supervised \ufb01netuning. The video aggregator and cross attention layers have 0.6B and 4.6B parameters\\nfor Llama 3 7B and 70B, respectively.\\n7.3 Model Scaling\\nAfter the visual-recognition components are added to Llama 3, the model contains self-attention layers, cross-\\nattention layers, and a ViT image encoder. To train adapters for the smaller 8B and 70B parameter models,\\nwe found a combination of data and tensor parallelization is the most e\ufb03cient. Model or pipeline parallelism\\ndoes not increase e\ufb03ciency at these scales because the gathering of model parameters would dominate the\\ncomputation. We do, however, use pipeline parallelism (in addition to data and tensor parallelism) when\\ntraining the adapter for the 405B parameter model. Training at this scale introduces three new challenges in' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 56}", "page_content='training the adapter for the 405B parameter model. Training at this scale introduces three new challenges in\\naddition to those outlined in Section 3.3: model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and numerical instabilities.\\nModel heterogeneity. The model computation is heterogeneous because more computation is performed on\\nsome tokens than on others. In particular, image tokens are processed by the image encoder and the cross-\\nattention layers, whereas text tokens are only processed by the language backbone. This heterogeneity leads\\nto bottlenecks in the scheduling of pipeline parallelism. We address this problem by ensuring each pipeline\\nstage contains \ufb01ve layers: namely, four self-attention layers in the language backbone and a cross-attention\\nlayer. (Recall that we introduce a cross-attention layer after every fourth self-attention layer.) In addition, we\\nreplicate the image encoder on all pipeline stages. Because we train on paired image-text data, this enables us\\nto perform load balancing between the image and text parts of the computation.\\n57' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 56}", "page_content='Data heterogeneity. The data is heterogeneous because, on average, images have more tokens than the\\nassociated text: an image has 2,308 tokens, whereas the associated text contains an average of only 192 tokens.\\nAs a result, the computation of cross-attention layers requires more time and memory than the computation\\nof self-attention layers. We address this problem by introducing sequence parallelization in the image encoder,\\nso that each GPU processes roughly the same number of tokens. Because the average text size is relatively\\nshort, we also use a substantially larger micro-batch size (8 instead of 1).\\nNumerical instabilities. After the image encoder is added to the model, we \ufb01nd that performing gradient\\naccumulation in bf16 led to numerical instabilities. The most likely explanation for this is that image tokens\\nare introduced into the language backbone via allcross-attention layers. This implies that numerical deviations\\nin the representation of an image token have an outsized impact on the overall computation because the errors\\nare compounded. We address this by performing gradient accumulation in FP32.\\n7.4 Pre-training\\nImage.We initialize from the pre-trained text model and vision encoder weights. The vision encoder is\\nunfrozen, while the text model weights are kept frozen as explained above. First, we train the model using 6B\\nimage-text pairs where each image is resized to \ufb01t within four tiles of 336\u00d7336pixels. We use a global batch\\nsize of 16,384 and a cosine learning rate schedule with initial learning rate 10\u00d710\u22124and a weight decay of\\n0.01. The initial learning rate was determined based on small-scale experiments. However, these \ufb01ndings did\\nnot generalize well to very long training schedules and dropped the learning rate a few times during training\\nwhen the loss values became stagnant. After the base pre-training, we increase the image resolution further\\nand continue training the same weights on the annealing dataset. The optimizer is re-initialized via warm-up\\nto learning rate 2\u00d710\u22125and again follows a cosine schedule.\\nVideo.For video pre-training, we start from the image pre-trained and annealed weights as described above. We\\nadd the video aggregator and cross-attention layers as described in the architecture, initialized randomly. We\\nfreeze all the parameters in the model except the video-speci\ufb01c ones (the aggregator and video cross-attention),\\nand train them on the video pre-training data. We use the same training hyperparameters as the image\\nannealing stage, with small di\ufb00erences in the learning rate. We uniformly sample 16 frames from the full video,\\nand represent each frame using four chunks, each of size of 448\u00d7448pixels. We use an aggregation factor of\\n16 in the video aggregator, hence obtaining one e\ufb00ective frame, which the text tokens cross-attend to. We use\\na global batch size of 4,096, a sequence length of 190 tokens, and a learning rate of 10\u22124during training.\\n7.5 Post-Training\\nIn this section, we describe the post-training recipe for our vision adapters. After pre-training, we \ufb01ne-tune the\\nmodel on highly curated multi-modal conversational data to enable chat capabilities. We further implement\\ndirect preference optimization (DPO) to boost human evaluation performance and rejection sampling to\\nimprove multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Finally, we add a quality-tuning stage where we continue \ufb01ne-\\ntuning the model on a very small set of high-quality conversational data which further boosts human evaluation\\nwhile retaining performance across benchmarks. More details on each of these steps are provided below.\\n7.5.1 Supervised Finetuning Data\\nWe describe our supervised \ufb01netuning (SFT) data for image and video capabilities separately below.\\nImage.We utilize a mix of di\ufb00erent datasets for supervised \ufb01netuning.\\n\u2022Academic datasets.

We collect multi-modal conversation data via human annotators for a wide range of\\ntasks (open-ended question-answering, captioning, practical use cases, etc.) and domains ( e.g., natural\\nimages and structured images). Annotators are provided with images and asked to write conversations.\\nTo ensure diversity, we cluster large-scale datasets and sampled images uniformly across di\ufb00erent clusters.\\nFurther, we acquire additional images for a few speci\ufb01c domains by expanding a seed via k-nearest\\n58' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 57}", "page_content='neighbors. Annotators are also provided with intermediate checkpoints of existing models to facilitate\\nmodel-in-the-loop style annotations, so that model generations can be utilized as a starting point by\\nthe annotators to then provide additional human edits. This is an iterative process, in which model\\ncheckpoints would be regularly updated with better performing versions trained on the latest data. This\\nincreases the volume and e\ufb03ciency of human annotations, while also improving their quality.\\n\u2022Synthetic data. We explore di\ufb00erent ways to generate synthetic multi-modal data by using text-\\nrepresentations of images and a text-input LLM. The high-level idea is to utilize the reasoning capa-\\nbilities of text-input LLMs to generate question-answer pairs in the text domain, and replace the text\\nrepresentation with its corresponding images to produce synthetic multi-modal data. Examples include\\nrendering texts from question-answer datasets as images or rendering table data into synthetic images of\\ntables and charts. Additionally, we use captions and OCR extractions from existing images to generate\\nadditional conversational or question-answer data related to the images.\\nVideo.Similar to the image adapter, we use academic datasets with pre-existing annotations and convert them\\ninto appropriate textual instructions and target responses. The targets are converted to open-ended responses\\nor multiple-choice options, whichever is more appropriate. We ask humans to annotate videos with questions\\nand corresponding answers. The annotators are asked to focus on questions that could not be answered based\\non a single frame, to steer the annotators towards questions that require temporal understanding.\\n7.5.2 Supervised Finetuning Recipe\\nWe describe our supervised \ufb01netuning (SFT) recipe for image and video capabilities separately below.\\nImage.We initialize from the pre-trained image adapter, but hot-swap the pre-trained language model\u2019s\\nweights with the instruction tuned language model\u2019s weights. The language model weights are kept frozen to\\nmaintain text-only performance, i.e., we only update the vision encoder and image adapter weights.\\nOur approach to \ufb01netune the model is similar to Wortsman et al. (2022). First, we run a hyperparameter\\nsweep using multiple random subsets of data, learning rates and weight decay values. Next, we rank the\\nmodels based on their performance. Finally, we average the weights of the top- Kmodels to obtain the \ufb01nal\\nmodel. The value of Kis determined by evaluating the averaged models and selecting the instance with\\nhighest performance. We observe that the averaged models consistently yield better results compared to the\\nbest individual model found via grid search. Further, this strategy reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters.\\nVideo.For video SFT, we initialize the video aggregator and cross-attention layers using the pre-trained\\nweights. The rest of the parameters in the model, the image weights and the LLM, are initialized from\\ncorresponding models following their \ufb01netuning stages. Similar to video pre-training, we then \ufb01netune only\\nthe video parameters on the video SFT data. For this stage, we increase the video length to 64 frames, and\\nuse an aggregation factor of 32 to get two e\ufb00ective frames. The resolution of the chunks is also increased to\\nbe consistent with the corresponding image hyperparameters.\\n7.5.3 Preference Data\\nWe built multimodal pair-wise preference datasets for reward modeling and direct preference optimization.\\n\u2022Human annotations. The human-annotated preference data consists of comparisons between two di\ufb00erent\\nmodel outputs, labeled as \u201cchosen\u201d and \u201crejected\u201d, with 7-scale ratings. The models used to generate\\nresponses are sampled on-the-\ufb02y from a pool of the best recent models, each with di\ufb00erent characteristics.\\nWe update the model pool weekly. Besides preference labels, we also request annotators to provide' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 58}", "page_content='We update the model pool weekly.

Synthetic preference pairs could also be generated by using text-only LLMs to edit and\\ndeliberately introduce errors in the supervised \ufb01netuning dataset. We took the conversational data as\\ninput, and use an LLM to introduce subtle but meaningful errors ( e.g., change objects, change attributes,\\nadd mistakes in calculations, etc.). These edited responses are used as negative \u201crejected\u201d samples and\\npaired with the \u201cchosen\u201d original supervised \ufb01netuning data.\\n59' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 58}", "page_content='\u2022Rejection sampling. Furthermore, to create more on-policy negative samples, we leveraged the iterative\\nprocess of rejection sampling to collect additional preference data. We discuss our usage of rejection\\nsampling in more detail in the following sections. At a high-level, rejection sampling is used to iteratively\\nsample high-quality generations from a model. Therefore, as a by-product, all generations that are not\\nselected can be used as negative rejected samples and used as additional preference data pairs.\\n7.5.4 Reward Modeling\\nWe train a vision reward model (RM) on top of the vision SFT model and the language RM. The vision\\nencoder and the cross-attention layers are initialized from the vision SFT model and unfrozen during training,\\nwhile the self-attention layers are initialized from the language RM and kept frozen. We observe that freezing\\nthe language RM part generally leads to better accuracy, especially on tasks that require the RM to judge\\nbased on its knowledge or the language quality. We adopt the same training objective as the language RM,\\nbut adding a weighted regularization term on the square of the reward logits averaged over the batch, which\\nprevents the reward scores from drifting.\\nThe human preference annotations in Section 7.5.3 are used to train the vision RM. We follow the same\\npractice as language preference data (Section 4.2.1) to create two or three pairs with clear ranking ( edited\\n>chosen>rejected). In addition, we also synthetically augment the negative responses by perturbing the\\nwords or phrases related to the information in the image (such as numbers or visual texts). This encourages\\nthe vision RM to ground its judgement based on the actual image content.\\n7.5.5 Direct Preference Optimization\\nSimilar to the language model (Section 4.1.4), we further train the vision adapters with Direct Preference\\nOptimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. (2023)) using the preference data described in Section 7.5.3. To combat the\\ndistribution shift during post-training rounds, we only keep recent batches of human preference annotations\\nwhile dropping batches that are su\ufb03ciently o\ufb00-policy ( e.g., if the base pre-trained model is changed). We \ufb01nd\\nthat instead of always freezing the reference model, updating it in an exponential moving average (EMA)\\nfashion every k-steps helps the model learn more from the data, resulting in better performance in human\\nevaluations. Overall, we observed that the vision DPO model consistently performs better than its SFT\\nstarting point in human evaluations for every \ufb01netuning iteration.\\n7.5.6 Rejection Sampling\\nMost available question-answer pairs only contain the \ufb01nal answer and lack the chain-of-thought explanation\\nthat is required to train a model that generalizes well for reasoning tasks. We use rejection sampling to\\ngenerate the missing explanations for such examples and boost the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities.\\nGiven a question-answer pair, we generate multiple answers by sampling the \ufb01netuned model with di\ufb00erent\\nsystem prompts or temperature. Next, we compare the generated answers to the ground-truth via heuristics\\nor an LLM judge. Finally, we retrain the model by adding the correct answers back into the \ufb01netuning data\\nmix. We \ufb01nd it useful to keep multiple correct answers per question.\\nTo ensure we only add high-quality examples back into training, we implemented the following two guardrails.\\nFirst, we \ufb01nd that some examples contain incorrect explanations, despite the \ufb01nal answer being correct. We\\nobserved that this pattern occurs more frequently for questions where only a small fraction of the generated\\nanswers is correct. Therefore, we drop answers for questions where the probability of the answer being correct\\nis below a certain threshold. Second, raters prefer some answers over others due to di\ufb00erences in language or\\nstyle. We use the reward model to select top- Khighest-quality answers and add them back into training.\\n7.5.7 Quality Tuning' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 59}", "page_content='style.

On the input side, an encoder, together with an\\nadapter, is incorporated to process speech signals. We leverage a system prompt (in text) to enable di\ufb00erent\\nmodes of operation for speech understanding in Llama 3. If no system prompt is provided, the model acts as\\na general-purpose spoken dialogue model which can e\ufb00ectively respond to the user speech in a manner that is\\nconsistent with the text-only version of Llama 3. The dialogue history is introduced as the prompt pre\ufb01x to\\nimprove the multi-round dialogue experience. We also experiment with system prompts that enable the use\\nof Llama 3 for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST). The speech\\ninterface of Llama 3 supports up to 34 languages.18It also allows for the interleaved input of text and speech,\\nenabling the model to solve advanced audio-comprehension tasks.\\nWe also experiment with a speech generation approach in which we implement a streaming text-to-speech\\n(TTS) system that generates speech waveforms on-the-\ufb02y during language model decoding. We design the\\nspeech generator for Llama 3 based on a proprietary TTS system and do not \ufb01ne-tune the language model for\\nspeech generation. Instead, we focus on improving speech synthesis latency, accuracy, and naturalness by\\nleveraging Llama 3 embeddings at inference time. The speech interface is illustrated in Figure 28 and 29.\\n8.1 Data\\n8.1.1 Speech Understanding\\nThe training data can be categorized into two types. The pre-training data includes a large amount of\\nunlabeled speech, which is used to initialize the speech encoder in a self-supervised manner. The supervised\\n\ufb01netuning data includes speech recognition, speech translation, and spoken dialogue data; this data is used to\\nunlock speci\ufb01c abilities when integrated with the large language model.\\nPre-training data. To pre-train the speech encoder, we curate a dataset of approximately 15M hours of speech\\nrecordings encompassing a large number of languages. We \ufb01lter our audio data using a voice activity detection\\n(VAD) model and select audio samples with a VAD threshold above 0.7 for pre-training. In speech pre-training\\ndata, we also focus on ensuring the absence of PII. We use the Presidio Analyzer to identify such PII.\\nSpeech recognition and translation data. Our ASR training data contains 230K hours of manually transcribed\\nspeech recordings that span 34 languages. Our AST training data contains 90K hours of translations in\\ntwo directions: from 33 languages to English and from English to 33 languages. This data contains both\\nsupervised and synthetic data generated using the NLLB toolkit (NLLB Team et al., 2022). The use of\\nsynthetic AST data enables us to increase model quality for low-resource languages. The speech segments in\\nour data have a maximum length of 60 seconds.\\nSpoken dialogue data. To \ufb01netune the speech adapter for spoken dialogue, we synthetically generate responses\\n18The speech interface supports the following 34 languages: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French,\\nGerman, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Malayalam, Marathi, Persian,\\nPolish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese.\\n63' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 62}", "page_content='for speech prompts by asking the language model to respond to transcriptions of those prompts (Fathullah\\net al., 2024).

We used several heuristics to select a subset of \ufb01netuning\\ndata that matches the distribution of speech. These heuristics include focusing on relatively short prompts\\nwith a simple structure and without non-text symbols.\\n8.1.2 Speech Generation\\nThe speech generation datasets mainly consist of those for training the text normalization (TN) model and\\nthe prosody model (PM). Both training data are augmented with an additional input feature of the Llama 3\\nembeddings to provide contextual information.\\nText normalization data. Our TN training dataset includes 55K samples that cover a wide range of semiotic\\nclasses (e.g., number, date, time) that require non-trivial normalization. Each sample is a pair of written-form\\ntext and the corresponding normalized spoken-form text, with an inferred sequence of handcrafted TN rules\\nthat carry out the normalization.\\nProsody model data. The PM training data includes linguistic and prosodic features extracted from a 50K-hour\\nTTS dataset, which are paired transcripts and audios recorded by professional voice actors in studio settings.\\nLlama 3 embedding. The Llama 3 embeddings are taken as the output of the 16th decoder layer. We work\\nexclusively with the Llama 3 8B model and extract the embeddings for a given text ( i.e.written-form input\\ntext for TN or the audio transcript for PM) as if they are generated by the Llama 3 model with an empty\\nuser prompt. In a given sample, each chunk in the Llama 3 token sequence is explicitly aligned with the\\ncorresponding chunks in native input sequence for TN or PM, i.e., TN-speci\ufb01c text tokens (demarcated by\\nunicode category) or phone-rate features respectively. This allows for training the TN and PM modules with\\nstreaming input of Llama 3 tokens and embeddings.\\n8.2 Model Architecture\\n8.2.1 Speech Understanding\\nOn the input side, the speech module consists of two successive modules: a speech encoder and an adapter.\\nThe output of the speech module is directly fed into the language model as token representation, enabling\\ndirect interaction between speech and text tokens. Furthermore, we incorporate two new special tokens\\nto enclose the sequence of speech representations. The speech module di\ufb00ers substantially from the vision\\nmodule (see Section 7), which feeds multi-modal information into the language model via cross-attention\\nlayers. By contrast, the speech module generates embeddings that can be seamlessly integrated with text\\ntokens, enabling the speech interface to leverage all the capabilities of the Llama 3 language model.\\nSpeech encoder. Our speech encoder is a Conformer (Gulati et al., 2020) model with 1B parameters. The\\ninput to the model consists of 80-dimensional mel-spectrogram features, which are \ufb01rst processed by a stride-4\\nstacking layer followed by a linear projection to reduce the frame length to 40 ms. The resulting features are\\nprocessed by an encoder with 24 Conformer layers. Each Conformer layer has a latent dimension of 1536,\\nand consists of two Macron-net style feed-forward networks with dimension 4096, a convolution module with\\nkernel size 7, and a rotary attention module (Su et al., 2024) with 24 attention heads.\\nSpeech adapter. The speech adapter contains about 100M parameters. It is composed of a convolution layer,\\na rotary Transformer layer, and a linear layer. The convolution layer has a kernel size of 3 and a stride of\\n2, which is designed to reduce the speech frame length to 80ms. This allows the model to provide more\\ncoarse-grained features to the language model. The Transformer layer has a latent dimension of 3072 and a' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 63}", "page_content='coarse-grained features to the language model.

The TN module ensures semantic correctness by contextually transforming written text\\ninto spoken form. The PM module enhances naturalness and expressiveness by predicting prosodic features\\nusing these embeddings. Together, they enable accurate and natural speech generation.\\nText normalization. As a determinant of the semantic correctness of generated speech, the text normalization\\n(TN) module carries out context-aware transformation from written-form text into the respective spoken form\\nwhich is eventually verbalized by the downstream components. For example, the written-form text 123is\\nread as a cardinal number ( one hundred twenty three ) or spelled digit-by-digit ( one two three ) depending\\non the semantic context. The TN system consists of a streaming LSTM-based sequence-tagging model that\\npredicts the sequence of handcrafted TN rules used to transform the input text (Kang et al., 2024). The\\nneural model also takes in Llama 3 embeddings via cross attention to leverage the contextual information\\nencoded therein, enabling minimal text token lookahead and streaming input/output.\\nProsody modeling. To enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech, we integrate a\\ndecoder-only Transformer-based Prosody model (PM) (Radford et al., 2021) that takes the Llama 3 embeddings\\nas an additional input. This integration leverages the linguistic capabilities of Llama 3, utilizing both its\\ntextual output and intermediate embeddings at the token rate (Devlin et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2019; Ra\ufb00el\\net al., 2020; Guo et al., 2023) to enhance the prediction of prosody features, thus reducing the lookahead\\nrequired by the model.\\nThe PM integrates several input components to generate comprehensive prosody predictions: linguistic features\\nderived from the text normalization front-end detailed above, tokens, and embeddings. The PM predicts three\\nkey prosodic features: log duration of each phone, log F0 (fundamental frequency) average, and log power\\naverage across the phone duration. The model comprises a uni-directional Transformer and six attention\\nheads. Each block includes cross-attention layers and dual fully connected layers with a hidden dimension\\nof 864. A distinctive feature of the PM is its dual cross-attention mechanism, with one layer dedicated to\\nlinguistic inputs and the other to Llama embeddings. This setup e\ufb03ciently manages varying input rates\\nwithout requiring explicit alignment.\\n8.3 Training Recipe\\n8.3.1 Speech Understanding\\nTraining of the speech module is done in two stages. The \ufb01rst stage, speech pre-training, leverages unlabeled\\ndata to train a speech encoder that exhibits strong generalization capabilities across languages and acoustic\\nconditions. In the second stage, supervised \ufb01ne-tuning, the adapter and pre-trained encoder are integrated\\nwith the language model, and trained jointly with it while the LLM stays frozen. This enables the model to\\nrespond to speech input. This stage uses labeled data corresponding to speech understanding abilities.\\nMultilingual ASR and AST modeling often results in language confusion/interference, which leads to degraded\\nperformance. A popular way to mitigate this is to incorporate language identi\ufb01cation (LID) information,\\nboth on the source and target side. This can lead to improved performance in the predetermined set of\\ndirections, but it does come with potential loss of generality. For instance, if a translation system expects\\nLID on both source and target side, then the model will not likely to show good zero-shot performance in\\ndirections that were not seen in training.

We develop a dynamic alignment strategy utilizing causal masking to facilitate streamability in\\nspeech synthesis.

During inference, the same lookahead mechanism and causal masking strategy are employed to\\nensure consistency between training and real-time processing. The PM handles incoming text in a streaming\\nmanner, updating the input phone by phone for phone-rate features and chunk by chunk for token-rate\\nfeatures. The new chunk input is updated only when the \ufb01rst phone for that chunk is current, maintaining\\nthe alignment and lookahead as during training.\\nFor prosody target prediction, we employ a delayed pattern approach (Kharitonov et al., 2021), which enhances\\nthe model\u2019s ability to capture and reproduce long-range prosodic dependencies.

A comprehensive overview of that work is outside the scope of this paper; we\\nrefer the reader to Bordes et al. (2024); Madan et al. (2024); Zhao et al. (2023a) for such overviews. Below,\\nwe brie\ufb02y outline seminal works that directly in\ufb02uenced the development of Llama 3.\\n9.1 Language\\nScale.Llama 3 follows the enduring trend of applying straightforward methods at ever increasing scales in\\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\\nusing almost \ufb01fty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Ho\ufb00mann\\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\\ne\ufb00ectively trading training compute for inference e\ufb03ciency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modi\ufb01ations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an e\ufb03cient way to increase\\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snow\ufb02ake, 2024). Llama 3\\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\\nnumerous trade o\ufb00s in terms of training and inference e\ufb03ciency, and model stability at scale.\\nOpen source. Open weights foundation models have rapidly improved over the last year, with Llama3-405B\\nnow competitive with the current closed weight state-of-the-art. Numerous model families have recently been\\ndeveloped, including Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), MPT (Databricks, 2024),\\nPythia (Biderman et al., 2023), Arctic (Snow\ufb02ake, 2024), OpenELM (Mehta et al., 2024), OLMo (Groeneveld\\net al., 2024), StableLM (Bellagente et al., 2024), OpenLLaMA (Geng and Liu, 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023),\\nGemma (Team et al., 2024), Grok (XAI, 2024), and Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\\nPost-training. Post-training Llama 3 follows the established strategy of instruction tuning (Chung et al., 2022;' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 68}", "page_content='Gemma (Team et al., 2024), Grok (XAI, 2024), and Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\\nPost-training. Post-training Llama 3 follows the established strategy of instruction tuning (Chung et al., 2022;\\nOuyang et al., 2022) followed by alignment with human feedback (Kaufmann et al., 2023). While some studies\\nhave shown the surprising e\ufb00ectiveness of lightweight alignment procedures (Zhou et al., 2024), Llama 3\\nuses millions of human instructions and preference judgments to improve the pre-trained model, including\\n69' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 68}", "page_content='techniques such as rejection sampling (Bai et al., 2022), supervised \ufb01netuning (Sanh et al., 2022), and Direct\\nPreference Optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023). In order to curate these instruction and preference examples,\\nwe deploy earlier versions of Llama 3 to \ufb01lter (Liu et al., 2024c), re-write (Pan et al., 2024), or generate\\nprompts and responses (Liu et al., 2024b) and apply these techniques through multiple rounds of post-training.\\n9.2 Multimodality\\nOur experiments with multimodal capabilities for Llama 3 are part of a long line of work on foundation\\nmodels that jointly model multiple modalities.\\nImages.A substantial body of work has trained image-recognition models on large amounts of image-text\\npairs, for example, Mahajan et al. (2018); Xiao et al. (2024a); Team (2024); OpenAI (2023b). Radford et al.\\n(2021) presented one of the \ufb01rst models to jointly embed images and text via contrastive learning. More\\nrecently, a series of models has studied approaches similar to the one used in Llama 3, for example, Alayrac\\net al. (2022); Dai et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023c,b); Yang et al. (2023b); Ye et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2023).\\nOur approach in Llama 3 combines ideas from many of these papers to achieve results that are comparable\\nwith Gemini 1.0 Ultra (Google, 2023) and GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI, 2023b); see Section 7.6.\\nVideo.Although video inputs are supported by an increasing number of foundation models (Google, 2023;\\nOpenAI, 2023b), the body of work on joint modeling of videos and language is not that large. Akin to Llama\\n3, most current studies adopt an adapter approach to align video and language representations and unlock\\nquestion-answering and reasoning about videos (Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Maaz et al., 2024; Zhang\\net al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022). We \ufb01nd that such approaches produce results that are competitive with the\\nstate-of-the-art; see Section 7.7.\\nSpeech. Our work also \ufb01ts in a larger body of work combining language and speech modeling. Earlier joint\\nmodels of text and speech include AudioPaLM (Rubenstein et al., 2023), VioLA (Wang et al., 2023b), VoxtLM\\nMaiti et al. (2023), SUTLM (Chou et al., 2023), and Spirit-LM (Nguyen et al., 2024). Our work builds\\non prior compositional approaches to combining speech and language like Fathullah et al. (2024). Unlike\\nmost prior work, we opt to not \ufb01netune the language model itself for speech tasks as doing so may lead to\\ncontention on non-speech tasks. We \ufb01nd that at larger model scales, strong performances are attainable even\\nwithout such \ufb01netuning; see Section 8.4.\\n10 Conclusion\\nIn many ways, the development of high-quality foundation models is still in its infancy. Our experience\\nin developing Llama 3 suggests that substantial further improvements of these models are on the horizon.\\nThroughout the development of the Llama 3 model family, we found that a strong focus on high-quality data,\\nscale, and simplicity consistently yielded the best results. In preliminary experiments, we explored more\\ncomplex model architectures and training recipes but did not \ufb01nd the bene\ufb01ts of such approaches to outweigh\\nthe additional complexity they introduce in model development.\\nDeveloping a \ufb02agship foundation model such as Llama 3 involves overcoming a plethora of deep technical\\nproblems but also requires clever organizational decisions. For example, to ensure Llama 3 is not accidentally\\nover\ufb01tted on commonly used benchmarks, our pre-training data was procured and processed by a separate team\\nthat was strongly incentivized to prevent contamination of that pre-training data with external benchmarks.\\nAs another example, we ensure that our human evaluations remain trustworthy by allowing only a small set\\nof researchers who do not contribute to model development to perform and access these evaluations. While\\nsuch organizational decisions are rarely discussed in technical papers, we found them to be pivotal to the\\nsuccessful development of the Llama 3 family of models.' metadata={'source': '/Users/thoriq/Documents/books/452387774_1036916434819166_4173978747091533306_n.pdf', 'page': 69}", "page_content='such organizational decisions are rarely discussed in technical papers, we found them to be pivotal to the\\nsuccessful development of the Llama 3 family of models.\\nWe shared the details of our development process because we believe this will: (1)help the larger research\\ncommunity understand the key factors of foundation model development and (2)contribute to a more informed\\ndebate about the future of foundation models in the general public.

This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We \ufb01nd that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks.
